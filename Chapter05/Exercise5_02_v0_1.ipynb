       "'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, an international football tournament contested by the men\\'s national teams of the member associations of FIFA once every four years. It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018. It was the first World Cup to be held in Eastern Europe, and the 11th time that it had been held in Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup. It was also the first World Cup to use the video assistant referee (VAR) system.The finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation qualified automatically. Of the 32 teams, 20 had also appeared in the previous tournament in 2014, while both Iceland and Panama made their first appearances at a FIFA World Cup. A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany were the defending champions, but were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia were eliminated in the quarter-finals.\\nThe final took place on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, between France and Croatia. France won the match 4–2 to claim their second World Cup title, marking the fourth consecutive title won by a European team.\\n\\n\\n== Host selection ==\\n\\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest. Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from proceedings, and Indonesia\\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid. During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and the UEFA nations were thus ruled out of the 2022 bid. As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments. Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.The voting results were as follows:\\n\\n\\n=== Criticism ===\\nThe English Football Association and others raised concerns of bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption from FIFA members. They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said that it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win. The 2014 Garcia Report, an internal investigation led by Michael J. Garcia, was withheld from public release by Hans-Joachim Eckert, FIFA\\'s head of adjudication on ethical matters. Eckert instead released a shorter revised summary, and his (and therefore FIFA\\'s) reluctance to publish the full report caused Garcia to resign in protest. Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\\'s absolving of Russia from blame, with Greg Dyke calling for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein calling for a boycott of the World Cup.\\n\\n\\n== Teams ==\\n\\n\\n=== Qualification ===\\n\\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations – the 209 FIFA member associations minus automatically qualified hosts Russia – applied to enter the qualifying process. Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition. Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup. The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.Of the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup. Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments include: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, returning after 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.Notable countries that failed to qualify included four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden, three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the Netherlands (for the first time since 2002), and four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon, two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile, 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand, and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions United States (for the first time since 1986). The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, who had both made the previous three tournaments.Note: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== Draw ===\\n\\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow. The 32 teams were drawn into 8 groups of 4, by selecting one team from each of the 4 ranked pots.\\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017. Pot 1 contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams, pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots 3 and 4. This was different from previous draws, when only pot 1 was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations. However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.\\n\\n\\n=== Squads ===\\n\\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players but, in February 2018, this was increased to 35. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by 4 June. Players in the final squad may be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\\'s first match and such replacements do not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.For players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\\n\\n\\n== Officiating ==\\n\\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches. On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who solely acted in this capacity in the tournament.Referee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed in 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai. A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list. Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated Marwa in a bribery scandal.\\n\\n\\n=== Video assistant referees ===\\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the Game, on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.VAR operations for all games are operating from a single headquarters in Moscow, which receives live video of the games and are in radio contact with the on-field referees. Systems are in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\\' large screens are used for the fans in attendance.VAR had a significant impact in several games. On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\\'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann. A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, with this phenomenon being partially attributed to VAR. Overall, the new technology has been both praised and criticised by commentators. FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\\n\\n\\n== Venues ==\\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg. Most cities are in European Russia, while Yekaterinburg is very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\\'s minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"In October 2011, Russia decreased the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government, and also in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.The final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was further reduced to 11 and number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, 3 (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) have been extensively renovated and the other 9 stadiums to be used are brand new; $11.8 billion has been spent on hosting the tournament.Sepp Blatter stated in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10. He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".\\n\\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\\'s inspection committee and its head Chris Unger visited St Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the Local Organising Committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues used, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium – the two largest stadiums in Russia – were used most, both hosting seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara all hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk all hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\\n\\n\\n=== Stadiums ===\\n\\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, 9 of the 12 stadiums were built and the other 3 were renovated for the tournament.\\nKaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new). The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015. On 11 April 2018 the new stadium hosted its first match.\\nKazan: Kazan Arena (new). The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade. It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championship and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. The stadium serves as a home arena to FC Rubin Kazan.\\nMoscow: Luzhniki Stadium (renovated). The largest stadium in the country was closed for renovation in 2013. The stadium was commissioned in November 2017.\\nMoscow: Spartak Stadium (new). The stadium is a home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow. In accordance with the FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup it is called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena. The stadium hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.\\nNizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new). The construction of the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium commenced in 2015. The project was completed in December 2017.\\nRostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new). The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don River. The stadium construction was completed on 22 December 2017.\\nSaint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new). The construction of the stadium commenced in 2007 after the site clearance formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium. The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016. The stadium has hosted games of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and will serve as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.\\nSamara: Samara Arena (new). The construction officially started on 21 July 2014. The project was completed on 21 April 2018.\\nSaransk: Mordovia Arena (new). The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.\\nSochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 World Cup.\\nVolgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main arena of Volgograd was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex. The stadium was commissioned on 3 April 2018.\\nYekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg has been renovated for the FIFA World Cup. The arena\\'s stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators. The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\\n\\n\\n=== Team base camps ===\\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\\n\\n\\n== Preparation and costs ==\\n\\n\\n=== Budget ===\\n\\nAt an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion as of June 2018, it was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.The Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion which was later slashed to $10 billion for the preparations of the World Cup, of which half is spent on transport infrastructure. As part of the program for preparation to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program \"Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure\" was implemented with a total budget of 352.5 billion rubles, with 170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, 35.1 billion from regional budgets, and 147.1 billion from investors. The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure (117.8 billion rubles). Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in the World Cup host cities. Costs continued to balloon as preparations were underway.\\n\\n\\n=== Infrastructure spending ===\\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems, modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems. Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received its second runway strip. Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; the city also got two new hotels, Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk (Starwood Hotels) as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities. In Samara, new tram lines were laid. Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment. Renovation and upgrade of radio-engineering tools for flight operation was completed in the airports of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi. On 27 March, the Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of Russia reported that all communications within its area of responsibility have been commissioned. The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd. In Yekaterinburg, where four matches are hosted, hosting costs increased to over 7.4 billion rubles, over-running the 5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\\n\\n\\n=== Volunteers ===\\n\\nVolunteer applications to the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016. The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers. They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the Local Organising Committee based in 15 universities, and in Volunteer Centres in the host cities. Preference, especially in the key areas, was given to those with knowledge of foreign languages and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\\n\\n\\n=== Transport ===\\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking between host cities, as well as services such as bus service within them.\\n\\n\\n== Schedule ==\\n\\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 (without kick-off times, which were confirmed later). On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, six kick-off times were adjusted by FIFA.Russia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw. The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July. The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\\n\\n\\n== Opening ceremony ==\\n\\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.At the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force. Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia shirt. Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet. Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation. At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\\n\\n\\n== Group stage ==\\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin basis, with the top two teams of each group advancing to the knockout stage. Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany (the reigning champions) did not advance past the first round. For the first time since 1982, no African team progressed to the second round. For the first time, the fair play criteria came into use, when Japan qualified over Senegal due to having received fewer yellow cards. Only one match, France v Denmark, was goalless. Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\\n\\n\\n=== Tiebreakers ===\\nThe ranking of teams in the group stage was determined as follows:\\nPoints obtained in all group matches;\\nGoal difference in all group matches;\\nNumber of goals scored in all group matches;\\nPoints obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\\nGoal difference in the matches played between the teams in question;\\nNumber of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\\nFair play points in all group matches (only one deduction could be applied to a player in a single match): \\nDrawing of lots.\\n\\n\\n=== Group A ===\\n\\n\\n=== Group B ===\\n\\n\\n=== Group C ===\\n\\n\\n=== Group D ===\\n\\n\\n=== Group E ===\\n\\n\\n=== Group F ===\\n\\n\\n=== Group G ===\\n\\n\\n=== Group H ===\\n\\n\\n== Knockout stage ==\\n\\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== Bracket ===\\n\\n\\n=== Round of 16 ===\\n\\n\\n=== Quarter-finals ===\\n\\n\\n=== Semi-finals ===\\n\\n\\n=== Third place play-off ===\\n\\n\\n=== Final ===\\n\\n\\n== Statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Goalscorers ===\\nThere were 169 goals scored in 64 matches, for an average of 2.64 goals per match.\\nTwelve own goals were scored during the tournament, doubling the record of six set in 1998.6 goals\\n\\n4 goals\\n\\n3 goals\\n\\n2 goals\\n\\n1 goal\\n\\n1 own goal\\n\\nSource: FIFA\\n\\n\\n=== Discipline ===\\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978. International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.A player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\\nReceiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)\\nReceiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)The following suspensions were served during the tournament:\\n\\n\\n=== Awards ===\\n\\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournaments\\' best. The poll closed on 23 July. The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\\n\\n\\n==== Dream Team ====\\nAs was the case during the 2010 and 2014 editions, FIFA did not release an official All-Star Team, but instead invited users of FIFA.com to elect their Fan Dream Team.\\nFIFA also published an alternate team of the tournament based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\\n\\n\\n==== Prize money ====\\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Marketing ==\\n\\n\\n=== Branding ===\\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme. Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the logo was inspired by \"Russia\\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation\", and FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the \"heart and soul\" of the country. For the branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha (from душа, Russian for soul) designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of DSType Foundry in Portugal.\\n\\n\\n=== Mascot ===\\n\\nThe official mascot for the tournament was unveiled 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students. A public vote was used to select from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf. The winner, with 53% of approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team. Zabivaka\\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (\"hothead\") and забивать (\"to score\"), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is \"charming, confident and social\".\\n\\n\\n=== Ticketing ===\\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.The general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship. Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a \"Fan-ID\", a special photo identification pass. A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches. Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities. Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, who could revoke these accreditations at any time to \"ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order\".\\n\\n\\n=== Match ball ===\\n\\nThe official match ball, the \"Telstar 18\", was unveiled 9 November 2017. It is based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970. A special red-coloured variation, \"Telstar Mechta\", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament. The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means dream or ambition.Goalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory. In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\\'s performance.\\n\\n\\n=== Merchandise ===\\n\\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.Panini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album. Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with five million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== Official song ===\\n\\nThe official song of the tournament was \"Live It Up\", with vocals from Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018. Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\n\\nThirty-three footballers who are alleged to be part of the steroid program are listed in the McLaren Report. On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football. On 22 May 2018 FIFA confirmed that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to assert an anti-doping rule violation. FIFA\\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament; the action was taken to reassure teams that the samples would remain untampered.\\n\\n\\n=== Host selection ===\\nThe choice of Russia as host has been challenged. Controversial issues have included the level of racism in Russian football, and discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society. Russia\\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also caused calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea. In 2014, FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".Allegations of corruption in the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups caused threats from England\\'s FA to boycott the tournament. FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert\\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash. Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA\\'s Appeal Committee. The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA\\'s conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.On 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\". Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\\n\\n\\n=== Response to Skripal poisoning ===\\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans. Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup. Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\". The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism\".The British Foreign Office and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\". English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\n\\nAt the close of the World Cup Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it \"a resounding public relations success\" for Putin, adding, \"The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters. Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\\'s authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"FIFA President Gianni Infantino stated, \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\" Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever\", as 98% of the stadiums were sold out, there were three billion viewers on TV all around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.However, the tournament was called a distraction from the international isolation and economic difficulties Russia has been facing.\\n\\n\\n== Broadcasting rights ==\\n\\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.In February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov. Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets. However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.Broadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions. In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"beoutQ\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"In the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament. Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo\\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in network history).Unlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\\n\\n\\n== Sponsorship ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nFIFA World Cup hosts\\n2017 FIFA Confederations Cup\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nFIFA.com 2018 website\\nWelcome2018.com\\nOfficial Technical Report\\nResults at RSSSFThe 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was the 12th Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men\\'s national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was hosted between 30 May to 14 July across eleven venues in England and Wales with the tournament being the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup while for Wales it was their third.\\nThe tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams the previous edition with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of the round-robin matches which saw four games not have a result; India, Australia, England and New Zealand finished as the top four with Pakistan missing out by net run rate.\\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the final, which was played at Lord\\'s in London. The final which saw the first Super Over in an ODI, ended in a tie after the match ended with both teams scoring 241. England took home their first title by the boundary countback rule, which was later scrapped by the ICC. Overall, approximately 2.6 billion people around the world watched the tournament, making it the most-watched cricket competition as of 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Hosting ==\\nThe hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was played in Australia and New Zealand. It was the fifth Cricket World Cup played in England, following the 1975, 1979, 1983 and 1999 World Cups. Wales also hosted matches at the 1983 and 1999 tournaments, the latter also seeing matches played in Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands.\\n\\n\\n== Qualification ==\\n\\nThe 2019 World Cup featured 10 teams, a decrease from previous World Cups in 2011 and 2015 which featured 14 teams. The hosts (England) and the top seven other teams in the ICC One Day International rankings on 30 September 2017 earned an automatic qualification. Results from 19 September 2017 confirmed that these teams were Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka. The remaining two spots were decided by the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.At the time of the announcement of the qualification structure, ICC Associate and Affiliate Members, who were guaranteed four spots in the previous two World Cup tournaments, could now only be represented by at most two teams, and possibly none at all if they were beaten by the lowest-ranked Full Members in the Qualifier. It also meant that at least two of the ten Test-playing nations at the time of the announcement would have to play in the qualifying tournament, and could miss the World Cup finals entirely. Thus, this was the first World Cup to be contested without all of the Full Member nations being present.The final stage of the tournament was a \"Super Six\" group, from which the top two teams qualified for the 2019 World Cup. The West Indies were guaranteed a spot after defeating Scotland in the penultimate round. Afghanistan joined them after defeating Ireland in the final over of their match. This was the first time since 1983 that Zimbabwe had failed to qualify for a World Cup. Ireland also missed the competition for the first time since 2003, and, for the first time, no Associate nation participated.\\n\\n\\n== Venues ==\\nThe fixture list for the tournament was released on 26 April 2018 after the completion of an ICC meeting in Kolkata, India. London Stadium had been named as a possible venue in the planning stages, and in January 2017, the ICC completed an inspection of the ground, confirming that the pitch dimensions would be compliant with the requirements to host ODI matches. However, when the fixtures were announced, London Stadium was not included as a venue. All of the venues used are in England except for Sophia Gardens, which is in Wales.\\n\\n\\n== Squads ==\\n\\nAll the participating teams had to submit the names of their respective World Cup squads by 23 April 2019. The teams were allowed to change players in their 15-man squad anytime up to seven days before the start of the tournament. New Zealand was the first team to announce their World Cup squad. The oldest player of the tournament was South African player Imran Tahir, who was forty years old, while the youngest was Afghan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, who was eighteen.\\n\\n\\n== Match officials ==\\n\\nIn April 2019, the ICC named the officials for the tournament. Ian Gould announced that he would retire as an umpire following the conclusion of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n=== Umpires ===\\n\\n\\n=== Referees ===\\nThe ICC also named six match referees for the tournament.\\n\\n\\n== Prize money ==\\nThe International Cricket Council declared a total prize money pool of US$10 million for the tournament, the same as the 2015 edition. The prize money was allocated according to the performance of the team as follows:\\n\\n\\n== Warm-up matches ==\\nBefore the World Cup, the participating nations competed in 10 warm-up matches, which were played from 24 to 28 May 2019. These matches did not have One Day International (ODI) status as teams were allowed to field all 15 members of their squad.\\n\\n\\n== Opening ceremony ==\\n\\nThe opening ceremony took place on The Mall in central London during the evening of 29 May 2019, a day before the start of the World Cup. Andrew Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Shibani Dandekar hosted the event. A 60-second challenge took place among the 10 participating \\'teams\\', with each side represented by two guest figures each, involving Viv Richards, Anil Kumble, Mahela Jayawardene, Jacques Kallis, Brett Lee, Kevin Pietersen, Farhan Akhtar, Malala Yousafzai, Jaya Ahsan, Yohan Blake, Damayanthi Dharsha, Azhar Ali, Abdur Razzak, James Franklin, Steven Pienaar, Chris Hughes, Sean Fitzpatrick and Pat Cash, while David Boon was the umpire for the game. England won the game by scoring 74 points, and Australia came second with 69 points.Michael Clarke, who captained Australia to the title in 2015, took the World Cup trophy to the stage, accompanied by former England spin bowler Graeme Swann. The ceremony concluded with the official World Cup song, \"Stand By\", performed by Loryn and Rudimental.\\n\\n\\n== Group stage ==\\n\\nThe initial stage of the tournament saw the ten teams grouped together for a single round-robin in which each team played the other nine once for a total of 45 matches. Teams earned two points for a win and one for a tie or no-result (a minimum of 20 overs per side was needed to constitute a result). Matches in this stage had no reserve day set aside in the event of bad weather. After four games in seven days were rained off and complaints were made about the lack of reserve days, the ICC chief executive, Dave Richardson, said that trying to include reserve days \"would significantly increase the length of the tournament and practically would be extremely complex to deliver\".The top four teams from the group stage progressed to the knockout stage. If teams were tied on points, then the number of wins and then the net run rate was used to separate them. A similar format was previously used in the 1992 Cricket World Cup, though that tournament featured nine teams instead of ten.\\nFollowing the 2019 Pulwama attack, several former Indian players and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) called for the boycott of the group match fixture between India and Pakistan. They also wanted to have the Pakistan team banned from playing in the tournament. However, after conducting a board meeting in Dubai, the ICC rejected the BCCI\\'s proposal and confirmed that the scheduled match would go ahead as planned, despite the ongoing standoff between the two nations.\\n\\n\\n=== Points table ===\\n\\n\\n=== Summary ===\\n\\n\\n==== Week 1 ====\\n\\nThe tournament began on 30 May at The Oval in London, between the host nation, England, and South Africa. England batted first and, despite losing their first wicket to the second ball of the tournament, went on to score 311/8, with Ben Stokes top-scoring with 89 runs. South Africa were bowled out for 207, which included a collapse of eight wickets for 63 runs, to give England a victory by 104 runs. The next three matches were one-sided: in the first, the West Indies bowled out Pakistan for just 105 before chasing the target down in only 13.4 overs. The first double-header of the group stage saw comfortable wins for New Zealand and Australia, as they won by 10 and 7 wickets respectively over Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.At the Oval, in the fifth match of the group stage, Bangladesh made their highest score in an ODI, with 330/6. Mushfiqur Rahim top-scored for Bangladesh with 78, as he and Shakib Al Hasan had a 142-run partnership for the third wicket. In reply, the South Africans could not sustain a partnership with wickets falling regularly throughout their innings. Mustafizur Rahman took three wickets for Bangladesh as South Africa fell short by 21 runs. The following day saw Pakistan cause an upset over one of the tournament favourites, as they beat England by 14 runs at Trent Bridge. This was despite Joe Root (107) and Jos Buttler (103) both scoring centuries in the chase, as they became the first and second batsmen to score hundreds at the tournaments.Sri Lanka got off to a good start in their game against Afghanistan in Cardiff, reaching 144/1 in the 21st over. This was before three wickets in five balls from Mohammad Nabi provided the catalyst for a collapse that saw Sri Lanka bowled out for 201. Kusal Perera top-scored for Sri Lanka with 78, while Nabi took another wicket to finish with four for the innings. Rain reduced Afghanistan\\'s innings to 41 overs, but by the 14th over, they had already fallen to 57/5. A partnership of 64 from Najibullah Zadran (who top-scored with 43) and Gulbadin Naib steadied the innings for Afghanistan, but it was not enough, with Nuwan Pradeep taking two quick wickets as Afghanistan fell 34 runs short of their revised target. Wednesday saw a double-header being played at the Rose Bowl and The Oval. At the Rose Bowl, India started their campaign with a six-wicket win over South Africa. Yuzvendra Chahal took four wickets as he helped restrict the batsmen to a total of 227. In reply, Rohit Sharma scored 122 not out to help India chase the target with 15 balls to spare. The other match on the Wednesday saw Bangladesh give New Zealand a scare, as the Black Caps went from 160/2 to 191/5 chasing 244, before getting home with three overs to spare. Ross Taylor top-scored for New Zealand in the run-chase with 82, while Matt Henry was the pick of the bowlers with four wickets.\\n\\n\\n==== Week 2 ====\\nThe second week began in Nottingham, with Australia having an early batting collapse to fall to 38/4 early in their innings against the West Indies. Half-centuries from Steve Smith and Nathan Coulter-Nile helped Australia recover before they were bowled out for 288. In response, Chris Gayle had two overturned decisions go his way before he was dismissed for 21. Despite a 68 from Shai Hope, Australia won by 15 runs off the back of a five-wicket haul by Mitchell Starc. After the Friday match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Bristol was abandoned due to rain, the Saturday matches were played in nearby Cardiff and Taunton. At Cardiff, Jason Roy made the highest score of the tournament so far, with 153, as he was named man of the match in England\\'s 106-run victory over Bangladesh. In Taunton, a five-wicket haul from Kiwi bowler James Neesham led New Zealand to their third consecutive win, with a seven-wicket victory over Afghanistan.The final completed match of the week saw India defeat Australia by 36 runs at The Oval. Batting first, India targeted Marcus Stoinis and Adam Zampa\\'s bowling with a combined total of 113 runs coming from their 13 overs, as India scored 352/5. Shikhar Dhawan top-scored for India with 117, while Stoinis was the only bowler to take more than one wicket. In the run chase, Australia were behind the required run rate for much of their innings, despite half-centuries from David Warner, Steve Smith and Alex Carey, and were bowled out for 316, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah taking three wickets each. The following two games of the week were washed out. Only 7.2 overs of play was possible in the fixture between South Africa and the West Indies, while the match between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka was abandoned without the toss taking place. The following day at Taunton saw Australia open with a 146-run stand between David Warner and Aaron Finch, with Warner going on to get a century. Pakistan fought back into the innings, with Mohammad Amir taking five wickets, which restricted Australia to 307. In response, Pakistan could not get a partnership established with regular wickets coming from Australia; Pat Cummins finished his 10 overs with figures of 3/33. Sarfaraz Ahmed and Wahab Riaz tried to get Pakistan the victory with a quick-fire 64-run partnership, but it was not enough, with Starc taking two of the final three wickets in the 41-run victory.\\n\\n\\n==== Week 3 ====\\nAfter a fourth wash-out came in Nottingham to open up the third week, Joe Root scored his second century of the tournament and took two wickets in England\\'s eight-wicket victory over the West Indies at Southampton. However, the English victory was soured with Jason Roy missing the next two games with a hamstring injury after going off after the eighth over. South Africa recorded their first win of the tournament at Cardiff against Afghanistan, with Imran Tahir taking four wickets as Afghanistan were bowled out for 125. In reply, South Africa chased down their target for the loss of just one wicket. The other match on Saturday at The Oval saw Aaron Finch and Mitchell Starc guide Australia to an 87-run victory over Sri Lanka that sent them to the top of the table with eight points from five games. The following day saw rivals India and Pakistan face each other at Old Trafford. India scored 336/5 from their 50 overs, which included a man-of-the-match performance of 140 runs from Rohit Sharma. In response, Pakistan got off to a good start and were 117/1 at one stage before Kuldeep Yadav took two wickets in three balls to turn the tide for India, helping them to an 89-run victory via the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method.Monday saw Bangladesh defeat the West Indies by seven wickets at the County Ground in Taunton. This was thanks to a century from Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who scored 124 from 99 balls as they chased down the target of 322. In the West Indies\\' innings, Shai Hope top-scored with 96 runs from 121 balls as he and Evin Lewis (70) got the West Indies to 321/8 from their 50 overs. At Manchester, Eoin Morgan hit 17 sixes, a new world record in ODIs, as he top-scored for England with 148, leading the hosts to a total of 397/6, the highest total of the tournament so far. Afghanistan\\'s Rashid Khan conceded 110 runs without taking any wickets, the most expensive bowling spell in Cricket World Cup history. Hashmatullah Shahidi managed 76 in response for Afghanistan, but they were always behind the required rate and fell 150 runs short, managing 247 from their 50 overs. Wednesday saw South Africa taking on New Zealand at Edgbaston. With the match reduced to 49 overs each due to a wet outfield, South Africa posted a total of 241/6 with some late hitting from Rassie van der Dussen, who was unbeaten on 67, while Lockie Ferguson was the best of the bowlers with three wickets. In response, New Zealand were 137/5 at one stage, before a partnership from Kane Williamson (who went on to score a century) and Colin de Grandhomme guided New Zealand to their fourth victory of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n==== Week 4 ====\\nWeek four saw David Warner score 166, aided by a score of 89 from Usman Khawaja in Nottingham. Australia\\'s total of 381/5 proved out of reach for Bangladesh, despite Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim getting them within 48 runs of the target. Friday saw Lasith Malinga dismantle the English top order, as his four wickets helped Sri Lanka defend a total of 232 for their second win of the tournament. Despite the best efforts of Stokes, who was left stranded on 82*, England fell 20 short all out. Angelo Mathews top-scored for the Sri Lankans with an unbeaten 85, while Mark Wood was the best of the English bowlers with 3/40. The Saturday games saw the first elimination of the tournament, with Afghanistan\\'s loss to India at Southampton meaning they could no longer qualify for the knockout stage. Despite limiting India to 224 from their 50 overs, a Mohammed Shami hat-trick saw Afghanistan fall 11 runs short. The other match on the Saturday saw a close game between New Zealand and the West Indies at Manchester. After New Zealand scored 291/8, including 148 from Kane Williamson, they had the West Indies reeling at 164/7 after 27 overs. The momentum, though, was swung to the West Indies, with Carlos Brathwaite making 101 (including five sixes and nine fours) as he led them to within five runs of the target; however, his attempt to finish off the game with a six saw him caught by Trent Boult at long on, as New Zealand won by only five runs.The following day saw South Africa eliminated from the World Cup after an 89-run performance from Haris Sohail got Pakistan to 308/7 before Shadab Khan took three wickets in the South African run chase to give Pakistan a 49-run victory. Monday saw Bangladesh record their third win of the tournament; a 62-run victory over Afghanistan at the Rose Bowl. The match also saw Bangladesh\\'s Shakib Al Hasan become the second player in World Cup history to take five wickets and score a half-century in the same match. Australia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals as a century from Aaron Finch, a five-wicket haul from Jason Behrendorff and another four from Mitchell Starc guided them to a 64-run victory over England at Lord\\'s, with only Stokes (89) showing any resistance to Australia\\'s bowling. The result left England needing to win both of their remaining two games to guarantee qualification for the semi-finals. Pakistan caused New Zealand\\'s first loss of the World Cup at Edgbaston with a Babar Azam century guiding them to a victory by six wickets.\\n\\n\\n==== Week 5 ====\\n\\nThe fifth week of the tournament started with India demolishing the West Indies by 125 runs at Old Trafford, with Mohammed Shami taking four wickets as they bowled the West Indies out for only 143. The result also knocked the West Indies out of the World Cup. The following day saw play suspended in the match between South Africa and Sri Lanka when bees swarmed the Riverside Ground pitch. Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla led the run chase with a partnership of 175 runs, taking South Africa to a nine-wicket victory. Saturday saw two matches played. At Lord\\'s, Starc became the first player to get three five-wicket hauls at a World Cup as he guided Australia to an 86-run victory over New Zealand. This was after Australia were 92/5 in the 22nd over before a century partnership between Khawaja and Carey got the total to 243/9. New Zealand managed just 157 in response, with Kane Williamson top-scoring with 40. The other match, played at Headingley, saw Afghanistan set 228 against Pakistan, with Shaheen Afridi taking four wickets. The run chase got off to a shaky start with Fakhar Zaman being bowled for a duck. However, Babar Azam and Imam-ul-Haq made a partnership of 72, but Pakistan\\'s progress was once again throttled by regular wickets, leaving them needing 46 runs from the last five overs. Imad Wasim immediately hit 18 runs in the 46th over, and despite losing Shadab Khan to a run out in the 47th, Wasim and Wahab Riaz saw Pakistan home to a three-wicket victory with only two balls to spare.The return of opener Jason Roy from injury helped England escape their slump as they emerged victorious by 31 runs against the hitherto unbeaten India in a crucial must-win game for the hosts. An opening partnership between Roy (66) and Jonny Bairstow (111) was the key factor in the victory, while Stokes scored 79 runs off 54 balls for his third consecutive half-century, to help England reach 337/7. The score proved too much for India, despite Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli scoring 102 and 66 respectively, while the returning England bowler Liam Plunkett took 3/55. Sri Lanka won the dead rubber against the West Indies at Chester-le-Street, where both Avishka Fernando and Nicholas Pooran scored their maiden ODI centuries. Bangladesh\\'s Shakib Al Hasan made history against India, as he became the first man to score 500 runs and take 10 wickets in a single World Cup. This performance was not enough, though, with a Rohit Sharma century leading India into the semi-finals at their opponents\\' expense.\\n\\n\\n==== Week 6 ====\\nThe final round started with England taking on New Zealand, with the winner guaranteed a semi-final position. Another Jonny Bairstow hundred saw England win by 119 runs and qualify for the semi-finals for the first time since 1992. After the West Indies won the dead rubber against Afghanistan at Leeds, Pakistan needed to win their final match against Bangladesh by a record margin of over 300 runs at Lord\\'s. They won, but only by 94 runs, allowing New Zealand to take the fourth and final semi-final berth. Despite Bangladesh losing the match, Shakib Al Hasan finished his tournament with 606 runs, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar\\'s record for the most runs in the group stage of a World Cup. Shakib\\'s record would very soon be surpassed by Rohit Sharma and David Warner by the end of the group stage, with former top-scoring in the group stage with 647 runs.The final two matches of the group stage were played on the Saturday to determine who would finish top of the group. At Leeds, India cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka off the back of centuries from K. L. Rahul and Rohit Sharma as they chased down a target of 265 runs with seven wickets to spare. Angelo Mathews scored his third ODI century for Sri Lanka, all of which had come against India. With South Africa defeating Australia by 10 runs, India finished top, sending Australia to a semi-final against England. A century from Faf du Plessis and a further 95 from Rassie van der Dussen saw South Africa set the Australians a target of 326. In response, Australia lost Usman Khawaja early on to a hamstring injury; he later returned but was dismissed for 18, before being ruled out for the rest of the tournament. David Warner scored 122, his third century of the tournament, and Alex Carey scored a career-best 85 but crucial wickets in the middle of the innings gave South Africa the victory by only 10 runs.\\n\\n\\n=== Fixtures ===\\nThe ICC released the fixture details on 26 April 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Knockout stage ==\\n\\nThe knockout stage started with semi-finals at Old Trafford and Edgbaston, the winners of each progressing to the final at Lord\\'s. All three knockout games were allotted a reserve day. If a reserve day came into play, the match would not be restarted but instead resumed from the previous day\\'s play, if there was any. In the event of no play on the scheduled day or the reserve day, in the semi-finals, the team that finished higher in the group stage progressed to the final, and if no play were possible in the final, the trophy would be shared. If any match ended in a tie, a Super Over would be used to determine the winner; each team would select three batsmen and a bowler, with the full team available to field. There would be no penalty for the loss of a wicket, but the loss of two wickets would end the Super Over. If the scores in the Super Over were also tied, the winner would be determined by the two teams\\' overall boundary count, including both the match itself and the Super Over.On 25 June 2019, Australia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals after beating England at Lord\\'s. India became the second team to qualify after they defeated Bangladesh at Edgbaston on 2 July 2019. The following day saw tournament hosts England become the third team to qualify after they beat New Zealand at the Riverside Ground. New Zealand were the fourth and final team to qualify for the semi-finals after Pakistan were unable to increase their net run rate sufficiently enough in their match against Bangladesh at Lord\\'s.The first semi-final was played between India and New Zealand at Old Trafford, while the second semi-final was played between Australia and England at Edgbaston.\\n\\n\\n=== Semi-finals ===\\nThe first semi-final between India and New Zealand was played at Old Trafford in Manchester. Batting first, New Zealand lost opener Martin Guptill in the fourth over, having scored just one run. However, the Indians found wickets hard to come by after that, as Kane Williamson combined with Henry Nicholls and Ross Taylor for partnerships of 68 and 65 respectively. Williamson managed 67 runs before he was the third man out in the 36th over, a score matched by Taylor when rain stopped play in the 47th over with New Zealand at 211/5 following the wickets of Neesham and De Grandhomme. No further play was possible on the day, so the match went into its reserve day. Taylor managed another seven runs to top-score for the Kiwis, who managed to get the score to 239/8 at the end of their 50 overs. The Indian chase got off to a poor start with India falling to 5/3 in the fourth over, with the top three batsmen all going for one run each, then 24/4 after 10 overs. After a small partnership of 47 runs for the fifth wicket between Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja was joined by MS Dhoni for a century partnership for the seventh wicket that left India needing 37 runs from the final three overs; however, a late-order collapse saw New Zealand take the last four wickets for just 13 runs, sending them into their second consecutive World Cup final.The second semi-final saw England take on Australia at Edgbaston. Australia won the toss and chose to bat first, but lost three of their top four batsmen for single-figure scores, two of them to Chris Woakes, to reduce them to 14/3 into the seventh over. Wicket-keeper Alex Carey was promoted up the order due to his recent form, and, after getting his helmet knocked off by a Jofra Archer bouncer, he scored 46 before being caught by Adil Rashid. As wickets continued to tumble at the other end, Steve Smith held his wicket to top-score with 85 as Australia were bowled out for 223 with Woakes and Rashid being the best of the bowlers with three wickets apiece. England took their time to get going in the run chase but were soon making progress, reaching 124 before Jonny Bairstow was trapped LBW by Starc for the first wicket. Quick-hitting Jason Roy went two overs later to a controversial decision, caught behind off a bouncer that appeared not to touch his bat, but England had already used their review on Bairstow\\'s wicket, and Roy departed for 85 off just 65 balls, including five sixes. Nevertheless, England were well over halfway to their target by this point, and an unbroken partnership of 79 between Joe Root and captain Eoin Morgan saw them home to an eight-wicket victory and their first World Cup final since 1992.\\n\\n\\n=== Final ===\\n\\nAfter New Zealand won the toss and chose to bat first, Henry Nicholls\\' first half-century of the tournament and a further 47 from wicket-keeper Tom Latham helped the Kiwis to a total of 241/8 from their 50 overs, as Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett each secured three wickets for the hosts. Defending a middling score, the New Zealand bowlers bowled effectively, hampering England\\'s top order, with only Jonny Bairstow managing more than a start with 36. With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over, however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught on 59. However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two dot balls, Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder\\'s throw deflected off Stokes\\' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the Laws of Cricket saying only one of the batsmen\\'s runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in. The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84*.With the scores tied, the match went to a Super Over. England returned Stokes and Buttler to the crease, and they handled Trent Boult\\'s bowling to accumulate 15 runs without loss. For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After Archer steady accumulation of runs which included a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery. Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy\\'s throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England\\'s superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand\\'s 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time after three previous final defeats in 1979, 1987 and 1992. Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be \"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life\", and later said England\\'s first World Cup victory was \"written in the stars\".\\n\\n\\n== Statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Most runs ===\\n\\n\\n=== Most wickets ===\\n\\n\\n=== Team of the tournament ===\\nThe ICC announced its team of the tournament on 15 July 2019 with Kane Williamson being named as player of the tournament and captain of the team.\\n\\n\\n== Broadcasting ==\\nThe ICC agreed deals for broadcast and digital distribution on a range of platforms, including television, radio and online streaming. The in-house ICC TV served as host broadcasters of the world feed, in collaboration with Sunset+Vine (as part of a new long-term agreement covering all ICC events, excluding the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup in India).In the United Kingdom, live coverage of the tournament was exclusive to pay television service Sky Sports, with free-to-air highlights packages sub-licensed to Channel 4. Sky later agreed to sub-license a simulcast of the final to Channel 4 if England reached the final. Sky Sport (New Zealand) also decided to air the final on its co-owned free-to-air channel Prime.Hotstar held digital rights to the tournament in India and several other markets. Hotstar surpassed 100 million daily users during the group match between India and Pakistan, and reached a record 25.3 million concurrent viewers during the semi-final between India and New Zealand.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nICC Cricket World Cup 2019 Playing Conditions, International Cricket Council\\nTournament home at ESPNcricinfo'"

       "'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, an international football tournament contested by the men\\'s national teams of the member associations of FIFA once every four years. It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018. It was the first World Cup to be held in Eastern Europe, and the 11th time that it had been held in Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup. It was also the first World Cup to use the video assistant referee (VAR) system.The finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation qualified automatically. Of the 32 teams, 20 had also appeared in the previous tournament in 2014, while both Iceland and Panama made their first appearances at a FIFA World Cup. A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany were the defending champions, but were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia were eliminated in the quarter-finals.\\nThe final took place on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, between France and Croatia. France won the match 4–2 to claim their second World Cup title, marking the fourth consecutive title won by a European team.\\n== Host selection ==\\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest. Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from proceedings, and Indonesia\\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid. During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and the UEFA nations were thus ruled out of the 2022 bid. As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments. Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.The voting results were as follows:\\n=== Criticism ===\\nThe English Football Association and others raised concerns of bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption from FIFA members. They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said that it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win. The 2014 Garcia Report, an internal investigation led by Michael J. Garcia, was withheld from public release by Hans-Joachim Eckert, FIFA\\'s head of adjudication on ethical matters. Eckert instead released a shorter revised summary, and his (and therefore FIFA\\'s) reluctance to publish the full report caused Garcia to resign in protest. Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\\'s absolving of Russia from blame, with Greg Dyke calling for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein calling for a boycott of the World Cup.\\n== Teams ==\\n=== Qualification ===\\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations – the 209 FIFA member associations minus automatically qualified hosts Russia – applied to enter the qualifying process. Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition. Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup. The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.Of the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup. Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments include: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, returning after 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.Notable countries that failed to qualify included four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden, three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the Netherlands (for the first time since 2002), and four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon, two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile, 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand, and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions United States (for the first time since 1986). The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, who had both made the previous three tournaments.Note: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\\n=== Draw ===\\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow. The 32 teams were drawn into 8 groups of 4, by selecting one team from each of the 4 ranked pots.\\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017. Pot 1 contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams, pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots 3 and 4. This was different from previous draws, when only pot 1 was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations. However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.\\n=== Squads ===\\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players but, in February 2018, this was increased to 35. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by 4 June. Players in the final squad may be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\\'s first match and such replacements do not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.For players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\\n== Officiating ==\\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches. On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who solely acted in this capacity in the tournament.Referee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed in 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai. A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list. Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated Marwa in a bribery scandal.\\n=== Video assistant referees ===\\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the Game, on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.VAR operations for all games are operating from a single headquarters in Moscow, which receives live video of the games and are in radio contact with the on-field referees. Systems are in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\\' large screens are used for the fans in attendance.VAR had a significant impact in several games. On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\\'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann. A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, with this phenomenon being partially attributed to VAR. Overall, the new technology has been both praised and criticised by commentators. FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\\n== Venues ==\\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg. Most cities are in European Russia, while Yekaterinburg is very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\\'s minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"In October 2011, Russia decreased the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government, and also in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.The final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was further reduced to 11 and number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, 3 (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) have been extensively renovated and the other 9 stadiums to be used are brand new; $11.8 billion has been spent on hosting the tournament.Sepp Blatter stated in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10. He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".\\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\\'s inspection committee and its head Chris Unger visited St Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the Local Organising Committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues used, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium – the two largest stadiums in Russia – were used most, both hosting seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara all hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk all hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\\n=== Stadiums ===\\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, 9 of the 12 stadiums were built and the other 3 were renovated for the tournament.\\nKaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new). The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015. On 11 April 2018 the new stadium hosted its first match.\\nKazan: Kazan Arena (new). The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade. It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championship and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. The stadium serves as a home arena to FC Rubin Kazan.\\nMoscow: Luzhniki Stadium (renovated). The largest stadium in the country was closed for renovation in 2013. The stadium was commissioned in November 2017.\\nMoscow: Spartak Stadium (new). The stadium is a home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow. In accordance with the FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup it is called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena. The stadium hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.\\nNizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new). The construction of the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium commenced in 2015. The project was completed in December 2017.\\nRostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new). The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don River. The stadium construction was completed on 22 December 2017.\\nSaint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new). The construction of the stadium commenced in 2007 after the site clearance formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium. The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016. The stadium has hosted games of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and will serve as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.\\nSamara: Samara Arena (new). The construction officially started on 21 July 2014. The project was completed on 21 April 2018.\\nSaransk: Mordovia Arena (new). The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.\\nSochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 World Cup.\\nVolgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main arena of Volgograd was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex. The stadium was commissioned on 3 April 2018.\\nYekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg has been renovated for the FIFA World Cup. The arena\\'s stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators. The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\\n=== Team base camps ===\\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\\n== Preparation and costs ==\\n=== Budget ===\\nAt an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion as of June 2018, it was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.The Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion which was later slashed to $10 billion for the preparations of the World Cup, of which half is spent on transport infrastructure. As part of the program for preparation to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program \"Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure\" was implemented with a total budget of 352.5 billion rubles, with 170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, 35.1 billion from regional budgets, and 147.1 billion from investors. The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure (117.8 billion rubles). Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in the World Cup host cities. Costs continued to balloon as preparations were underway.\\n=== Infrastructure spending ===\\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems, modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems. Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received its second runway strip. Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; the city also got two new hotels, Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk (Starwood Hotels) as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities. In Samara, new tram lines were laid. Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment. Renovation and upgrade of radio-engineering tools for flight operation was completed in the airports of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi. On 27 March, the Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of Russia reported that all communications within its area of responsibility have been commissioned. The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd. In Yekaterinburg, where four matches are hosted, hosting costs increased to over 7.4 billion rubles, over-running the 5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\\n=== Volunteers ===\\nVolunteer applications to the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016. The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers. They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the Local Organising Committee based in 15 universities, and in Volunteer Centres in the host cities. Preference, especially in the key areas, was given to those with knowledge of foreign languages and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\\n=== Transport ===\\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking between host cities, as well as services such as bus service within them.\\n== Schedule ==\\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 (without kick-off times, which were confirmed later). On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, six kick-off times were adjusted by FIFA.Russia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw. The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July. The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\\n== Opening ceremony ==\\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.At the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force. Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia shirt. Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet. Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation. At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\\n== Group stage ==\\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin basis, with the top two teams of each group advancing to the knockout stage. Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany (the reigning champions) did not advance past the first round. For the first time since 1982, no African team progressed to the second round. For the first time, the fair play criteria came into use, when Japan qualified over Senegal due to having received fewer yellow cards. Only one match, France v Denmark, was goalless. Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\\n=== Tiebreakers ===\\nThe ranking of teams in the group stage was determined as follows:\\nPoints obtained in all group matches;\\nGoal difference in all group matches;\\nNumber of goals scored in all group matches;\\nPoints obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\\nGoal difference in the matches played between the teams in question;\\nNumber of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\\nFair play points in all group matches (only one deduction could be applied to a player in a single match): \\nDrawing of lots.\\n=== Group A ===\\n=== Group B ===\\n=== Group C ===\\n=== Group D ===\\n=== Group E ===\\n=== Group F ===\\n=== Group G ===\\n=== Group H ===\\n== Knockout stage ==\\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\\n=== Bracket ===\\n=== Round of 16 ===\\n=== Quarter-finals ===\\n=== Semi-finals ===\\n=== Third place play-off ===\\n=== Final ===\\n== Statistics ==\\n=== Goalscorers ===\\nThere were 169 goals scored in 64 matches, for an average of 2.64 goals per match.\\nTwelve own goals were scored during the tournament, doubling the record of six set in 1998.6 goals\\n4 goals\\n3 goals\\n2 goals\\n1 goal\\n1 own goal\\nSource: FIFA\\n=== Discipline ===\\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978. International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.A player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\\nReceiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)\\nReceiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)The following suspensions were served during the tournament:\\n=== Awards ===\\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournaments\\' best. The poll closed on 23 July. The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\\n==== Dream Team ====\\nAs was the case during the 2010 and 2014 editions, FIFA did not release an official All-Star Team, but instead invited users of FIFA.com to elect their Fan Dream Team.\\nFIFA also published an alternate team of the tournament based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\\n==== Prize money ====\\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\\n== Marketing ==\\n=== Branding ===\\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme. Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the logo was inspired by \"Russia\\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation\", and FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the \"heart and soul\" of the country. For the branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha (from душа, Russian for soul) designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of DSType Foundry in Portugal.\\n=== Mascot ===\\nThe official mascot for the tournament was unveiled 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students. A public vote was used to select from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf. The winner, with 53% of approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team. Zabivaka\\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (\"hothead\") and забивать (\"to score\"), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is \"charming, confident and social\".\\n=== Ticketing ===\\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.The general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship. Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a \"Fan-ID\", a special photo identification pass. A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches. Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities. Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, who could revoke these accreditations at any time to \"ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order\".\\n=== Match ball ===\\nThe official match ball, the \"Telstar 18\", was unveiled 9 November 2017. It is based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970. A special red-coloured variation, \"Telstar Mechta\", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament. The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means dream or ambition.Goalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory. In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\\'s performance.\\n=== Merchandise ===\\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.Panini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album. Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with five million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\\n=== Official song ===\\nThe official song of the tournament was \"Live It Up\", with vocals from Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018. Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\\n== Controversies ==\\nThirty-three footballers who are alleged to be part of the steroid program are listed in the McLaren Report. On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football. On 22 May 2018 FIFA confirmed that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to assert an anti-doping rule violation. FIFA\\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament; the action was taken to reassure teams that the samples would remain untampered.\\n=== Host selection ===\\nThe choice of Russia as host has been challenged. Controversial issues have included the level of racism in Russian football, and discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society. Russia\\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also caused calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea. In 2014, FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".Allegations of corruption in the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups caused threats from England\\'s FA to boycott the tournament. FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert\\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash. Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA\\'s Appeal Committee. The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA\\'s conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.On 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\". Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\\n=== Response to Skripal poisoning ===\\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans. Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup. Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\". The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism\".The British Foreign Office and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\". English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\\n== Critical reception ==\\nAt the close of the World Cup Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it \"a resounding public relations success\" for Putin, adding, \"The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters. Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\\'s authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"FIFA President Gianni Infantino stated, \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\" Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever\", as 98% of the stadiums were sold out, there were three billion viewers on TV all around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.However, the tournament was called a distraction from the international isolation and economic difficulties Russia has been facing.\\n== Broadcasting rights ==\\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.In February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov. Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets. However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.Broadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions. In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"beoutQ\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"In the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament. Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo\\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in network history).Unlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\\n== Sponsorship ==\\n== See also ==\\nFIFA World Cup hosts\\n2017 FIFA Confederations Cup\\n== References ==\\n== External links ==\\nFIFA.com 2018 website\\nWelcome2018.com\\nOfficial Technical Report\\nResults at RSSSFThe 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was the 12th Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men\\'s national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was hosted between 30 May to 14 July across eleven venues in England and Wales with the tournament being the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup while for Wales it was their third.\\nThe tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams the previous edition with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of the round-robin matches which saw four games not have a result; India, Australia, England and New Zealand finished as the top four with Pakistan missing out by net run rate.\\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the final, which was played at Lord\\'s in London. The final which saw the first Super Over in an ODI, ended in a tie after the match ended with both teams scoring 241. England took home their first title by the boundary countback rule, which was later scrapped by the ICC. Overall, approximately 2.6 billion people around the world watched the tournament, making it the most-watched cricket competition as of 2019.\\n== Hosting ==\\nThe hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was played in Australia and New Zealand. It was the fifth Cricket World Cup played in England, following the 1975, 1979, 1983 and 1999 World Cups. Wales also hosted matches at the 1983 and 1999 tournaments, the latter also seeing matches played in Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands.\\n== Qualification ==\\nThe 2019 World Cup featured 10 teams, a decrease from previous World Cups in 2011 and 2015 which featured 14 teams. The hosts (England) and the top seven other teams in the ICC One Day International rankings on 30 September 2017 earned an automatic qualification. Results from 19 September 2017 confirmed that these teams were Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka. The remaining two spots were decided by the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.At the time of the announcement of the qualification structure, ICC Associate and Affiliate Members, who were guaranteed four spots in the previous two World Cup tournaments, could now only be represented by at most two teams, and possibly none at all if they were beaten by the lowest-ranked Full Members in the Qualifier. It also meant that at least two of the ten Test-playing nations at the time of the announcement would have to play in the qualifying tournament, and could miss the World Cup finals entirely. Thus, this was the first World Cup to be contested without all of the Full Member nations being present.The final stage of the tournament was a \"Super Six\" group, from which the top two teams qualified for the 2019 World Cup. The West Indies were guaranteed a spot after defeating Scotland in the penultimate round. Afghanistan joined them after defeating Ireland in the final over of their match. This was the first time since 1983 that Zimbabwe had failed to qualify for a World Cup. Ireland also missed the competition for the first time since 2003, and, for the first time, no Associate nation participated.\\n== Venues ==\\nThe fixture list for the tournament was released on 26 April 2018 after the completion of an ICC meeting in Kolkata, India. London Stadium had been named as a possible venue in the planning stages, and in January 2017, the ICC completed an inspection of the ground, confirming that the pitch dimensions would be compliant with the requirements to host ODI matches. However, when the fixtures were announced, London Stadium was not included as a venue. All of the venues used are in England except for Sophia Gardens, which is in Wales.\\n== Squads ==\\nAll the participating teams had to submit the names of their respective World Cup squads by 23 April 2019. The teams were allowed to change players in their 15-man squad anytime up to seven days before the start of the tournament. New Zealand was the first team to announce their World Cup squad. The oldest player of the tournament was South African player Imran Tahir, who was forty years old, while the youngest was Afghan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, who was eighteen.\\n== Match officials ==\\nIn April 2019, the ICC named the officials for the tournament. Ian Gould announced that he would retire as an umpire following the conclusion of the tournament.\\n=== Umpires ===\\n=== Referees ===\\nThe ICC also named six match referees for the tournament.\\n== Prize money ==\\nThe International Cricket Council declared a total prize money pool of US$10 million for the tournament, the same as the 2015 edition. The prize money was allocated according to the performance of the team as follows:\\n== Warm-up matches ==\\nBefore the World Cup, the participating nations competed in 10 warm-up matches, which were played from 24 to 28 May 2019. These matches did not have One Day International (ODI) status as teams were allowed to field all 15 members of their squad.\\n== Opening ceremony ==\\nThe opening ceremony took place on The Mall in central London during the evening of 29 May 2019, a day before the start of the World Cup. Andrew Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Shibani Dandekar hosted the event. A 60-second challenge took place among the 10 participating \\'teams\\', with each side represented by two guest figures each, involving Viv Richards, Anil Kumble, Mahela Jayawardene, Jacques Kallis, Brett Lee, Kevin Pietersen, Farhan Akhtar, Malala Yousafzai, Jaya Ahsan, Yohan Blake, Damayanthi Dharsha, Azhar Ali, Abdur Razzak, James Franklin, Steven Pienaar, Chris Hughes, Sean Fitzpatrick and Pat Cash, while David Boon was the umpire for the game. England won the game by scoring 74 points, and Australia came second with 69 points.Michael Clarke, who captained Australia to the title in 2015, took the World Cup trophy to the stage, accompanied by former England spin bowler Graeme Swann. The ceremony concluded with the official World Cup song, \"Stand By\", performed by Loryn and Rudimental.\\n== Group stage ==\\nThe initial stage of the tournament saw the ten teams grouped together for a single round-robin in which each team played the other nine once for a total of 45 matches. Teams earned two points for a win and one for a tie or no-result (a minimum of 20 overs per side was needed to constitute a result). Matches in this stage had no reserve day set aside in the event of bad weather. After four games in seven days were rained off and complaints were made about the lack of reserve days, the ICC chief executive, Dave Richardson, said that trying to include reserve days \"would significantly increase the length of the tournament and practically would be extremely complex to deliver\".The top four teams from the group stage progressed to the knockout stage. If teams were tied on points, then the number of wins and then the net run rate was used to separate them. A similar format was previously used in the 1992 Cricket World Cup, though that tournament featured nine teams instead of ten.\\nFollowing the 2019 Pulwama attack, several former Indian players and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) called for the boycott of the group match fixture between India and Pakistan. They also wanted to have the Pakistan team banned from playing in the tournament. However, after conducting a board meeting in Dubai, the ICC rejected the BCCI\\'s proposal and confirmed that the scheduled match would go ahead as planned, despite the ongoing standoff between the two nations.\\n=== Points table ===\\n=== Summary ===\\n==== Week 1 ====\\nThe tournament began on 30 May at The Oval in London, between the host nation, England, and South Africa. England batted first and, despite losing their first wicket to the second ball of the tournament, went on to score 311/8, with Ben Stokes top-scoring with 89 runs. South Africa were bowled out for 207, which included a collapse of eight wickets for 63 runs, to give England a victory by 104 runs. The next three matches were one-sided: in the first, the West Indies bowled out Pakistan for just 105 before chasing the target down in only 13.4 overs. The first double-header of the group stage saw comfortable wins for New Zealand and Australia, as they won by 10 and 7 wickets respectively over Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.At the Oval, in the fifth match of the group stage, Bangladesh made their highest score in an ODI, with 330/6. Mushfiqur Rahim top-scored for Bangladesh with 78, as he and Shakib Al Hasan had a 142-run partnership for the third wicket. In reply, the South Africans could not sustain a partnership with wickets falling regularly throughout their innings. Mustafizur Rahman took three wickets for Bangladesh as South Africa fell short by 21 runs. The following day saw Pakistan cause an upset over one of the tournament favourites, as they beat England by 14 runs at Trent Bridge. This was despite Joe Root (107) and Jos Buttler (103) both scoring centuries in the chase, as they became the first and second batsmen to score hundreds at the tournaments.Sri Lanka got off to a good start in their game against Afghanistan in Cardiff, reaching 144/1 in the 21st over. This was before three wickets in five balls from Mohammad Nabi provided the catalyst for a collapse that saw Sri Lanka bowled out for 201. Kusal Perera top-scored for Sri Lanka with 78, while Nabi took another wicket to finish with four for the innings. Rain reduced Afghanistan\\'s innings to 41 overs, but by the 14th over, they had already fallen to 57/5. A partnership of 64 from Najibullah Zadran (who top-scored with 43) and Gulbadin Naib steadied the innings for Afghanistan, but it was not enough, with Nuwan Pradeep taking two quick wickets as Afghanistan fell 34 runs short of their revised target. Wednesday saw a double-header being played at the Rose Bowl and The Oval. At the Rose Bowl, India started their campaign with a six-wicket win over South Africa. Yuzvendra Chahal took four wickets as he helped restrict the batsmen to a total of 227. In reply, Rohit Sharma scored 122 not out to help India chase the target with 15 balls to spare. The other match on the Wednesday saw Bangladesh give New Zealand a scare, as the Black Caps went from 160/2 to 191/5 chasing 244, before getting home with three overs to spare. Ross Taylor top-scored for New Zealand in the run-chase with 82, while Matt Henry was the pick of the bowlers with four wickets.\\n==== Week 2 ====\\nThe second week began in Nottingham, with Australia having an early batting collapse to fall to 38/4 early in their innings against the West Indies. Half-centuries from Steve Smith and Nathan Coulter-Nile helped Australia recover before they were bowled out for 288. In response, Chris Gayle had two overturned decisions go his way before he was dismissed for 21. Despite a 68 from Shai Hope, Australia won by 15 runs off the back of a five-wicket haul by Mitchell Starc. After the Friday match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Bristol was abandoned due to rain, the Saturday matches were played in nearby Cardiff and Taunton. At Cardiff, Jason Roy made the highest score of the tournament so far, with 153, as he was named man of the match in England\\'s 106-run victory over Bangladesh. In Taunton, a five-wicket haul from Kiwi bowler James Neesham led New Zealand to their third consecutive win, with a seven-wicket victory over Afghanistan.The final completed match of the week saw India defeat Australia by 36 runs at The Oval. Batting first, India targeted Marcus Stoinis and Adam Zampa\\'s bowling with a combined total of 113 runs coming from their 13 overs, as India scored 352/5. Shikhar Dhawan top-scored for India with 117, while Stoinis was the only bowler to take more than one wicket. In the run chase, Australia were behind the required run rate for much of their innings, despite half-centuries from David Warner, Steve Smith and Alex Carey, and were bowled out for 316, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah taking three wickets each. The following two games of the week were washed out. Only 7.2 overs of play was possible in the fixture between South Africa and the West Indies, while the match between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka was abandoned without the toss taking place. The following day at Taunton saw Australia open with a 146-run stand between David Warner and Aaron Finch, with Warner going on to get a century. Pakistan fought back into the innings, with Mohammad Amir taking five wickets, which restricted Australia to 307. In response, Pakistan could not get a partnership established with regular wickets coming from Australia; Pat Cummins finished his 10 overs with figures of 3/33. Sarfaraz Ahmed and Wahab Riaz tried to get Pakistan the victory with a quick-fire 64-run partnership, but it was not enough, with Starc taking two of the final three wickets in the 41-run victory.\\n==== Week 3 ====\\nAfter a fourth wash-out came in Nottingham to open up the third week, Joe Root scored his second century of the tournament and took two wickets in England\\'s eight-wicket victory over the West Indies at Southampton. However, the English victory was soured with Jason Roy missing the next two games with a hamstring injury after going off after the eighth over. South Africa recorded their first win of the tournament at Cardiff against Afghanistan, with Imran Tahir taking four wickets as Afghanistan were bowled out for 125. In reply, South Africa chased down their target for the loss of just one wicket. The other match on Saturday at The Oval saw Aaron Finch and Mitchell Starc guide Australia to an 87-run victory over Sri Lanka that sent them to the top of the table with eight points from five games. The following day saw rivals India and Pakistan face each other at Old Trafford. India scored 336/5 from their 50 overs, which included a man-of-the-match performance of 140 runs from Rohit Sharma. In response, Pakistan got off to a good start and were 117/1 at one stage before Kuldeep Yadav took two wickets in three balls to turn the tide for India, helping them to an 89-run victory via the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method.Monday saw Bangladesh defeat the West Indies by seven wickets at the County Ground in Taunton. This was thanks to a century from Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who scored 124 from 99 balls as they chased down the target of 322. In the West Indies\\' innings, Shai Hope top-scored with 96 runs from 121 balls as he and Evin Lewis (70) got the West Indies to 321/8 from their 50 overs. At Manchester, Eoin Morgan hit 17 sixes, a new world record in ODIs, as he top-scored for England with 148, leading the hosts to a total of 397/6, the highest total of the tournament so far. Afghanistan\\'s Rashid Khan conceded 110 runs without taking any wickets, the most expensive bowling spell in Cricket World Cup history. Hashmatullah Shahidi managed 76 in response for Afghanistan, but they were always behind the required rate and fell 150 runs short, managing 247 from their 50 overs. Wednesday saw South Africa taking on New Zealand at Edgbaston. With the match reduced to 49 overs each due to a wet outfield, South Africa posted a total of 241/6 with some late hitting from Rassie van der Dussen, who was unbeaten on 67, while Lockie Ferguson was the best of the bowlers with three wickets. In response, New Zealand were 137/5 at one stage, before a partnership from Kane Williamson (who went on to score a century) and Colin de Grandhomme guided New Zealand to their fourth victory of the tournament.\\n==== Week 4 ====\\nWeek four saw David Warner score 166, aided by a score of 89 from Usman Khawaja in Nottingham. Australia\\'s total of 381/5 proved out of reach for Bangladesh, despite Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim getting them within 48 runs of the target. Friday saw Lasith Malinga dismantle the English top order, as his four wickets helped Sri Lanka defend a total of 232 for their second win of the tournament. Despite the best efforts of Stokes, who was left stranded on 82*, England fell 20 short all out. Angelo Mathews top-scored for the Sri Lankans with an unbeaten 85, while Mark Wood was the best of the English bowlers with 3/40. The Saturday games saw the first elimination of the tournament, with Afghanistan\\'s loss to India at Southampton meaning they could no longer qualify for the knockout stage. Despite limiting India to 224 from their 50 overs, a Mohammed Shami hat-trick saw Afghanistan fall 11 runs short. The other match on the Saturday saw a close game between New Zealand and the West Indies at Manchester. After New Zealand scored 291/8, including 148 from Kane Williamson, they had the West Indies reeling at 164/7 after 27 overs. The momentum, though, was swung to the West Indies, with Carlos Brathwaite making 101 (including five sixes and nine fours) as he led them to within five runs of the target; however, his attempt to finish off the game with a six saw him caught by Trent Boult at long on, as New Zealand won by only five runs.The following day saw South Africa eliminated from the World Cup after an 89-run performance from Haris Sohail got Pakistan to 308/7 before Shadab Khan took three wickets in the South African run chase to give Pakistan a 49-run victory. Monday saw Bangladesh record their third win of the tournament; a 62-run victory over Afghanistan at the Rose Bowl. The match also saw Bangladesh\\'s Shakib Al Hasan become the second player in World Cup history to take five wickets and score a half-century in the same match. Australia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals as a century from Aaron Finch, a five-wicket haul from Jason Behrendorff and another four from Mitchell Starc guided them to a 64-run victory over England at Lord\\'s, with only Stokes (89) showing any resistance to Australia\\'s bowling. The result left England needing to win both of their remaining two games to guarantee qualification for the semi-finals. Pakistan caused New Zealand\\'s first loss of the World Cup at Edgbaston with a Babar Azam century guiding them to a victory by six wickets.\\n==== Week 5 ====\\nThe fifth week of the tournament started with India demolishing the West Indies by 125 runs at Old Trafford, with Mohammed Shami taking four wickets as they bowled the West Indies out for only 143. The result also knocked the West Indies out of the World Cup. The following day saw play suspended in the match between South Africa and Sri Lanka when bees swarmed the Riverside Ground pitch. Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla led the run chase with a partnership of 175 runs, taking South Africa to a nine-wicket victory. Saturday saw two matches played. At Lord\\'s, Starc became the first player to get three five-wicket hauls at a World Cup as he guided Australia to an 86-run victory over New Zealand. This was after Australia were 92/5 in the 22nd over before a century partnership between Khawaja and Carey got the total to 243/9. New Zealand managed just 157 in response, with Kane Williamson top-scoring with 40. The other match, played at Headingley, saw Afghanistan set 228 against Pakistan, with Shaheen Afridi taking four wickets. The run chase got off to a shaky start with Fakhar Zaman being bowled for a duck. However, Babar Azam and Imam-ul-Haq made a partnership of 72, but Pakistan\\'s progress was once again throttled by regular wickets, leaving them needing 46 runs from the last five overs. Imad Wasim immediately hit 18 runs in the 46th over, and despite losing Shadab Khan to a run out in the 47th, Wasim and Wahab Riaz saw Pakistan home to a three-wicket victory with only two balls to spare.The return of opener Jason Roy from injury helped England escape their slump as they emerged victorious by 31 runs against the hitherto unbeaten India in a crucial must-win game for the hosts. An opening partnership between Roy (66) and Jonny Bairstow (111) was the key factor in the victory, while Stokes scored 79 runs off 54 balls for his third consecutive half-century, to help England reach 337/7. The score proved too much for India, despite Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli scoring 102 and 66 respectively, while the returning England bowler Liam Plunkett took 3/55. Sri Lanka won the dead rubber against the West Indies at Chester-le-Street, where both Avishka Fernando and Nicholas Pooran scored their maiden ODI centuries. Bangladesh\\'s Shakib Al Hasan made history against India, as he became the first man to score 500 runs and take 10 wickets in a single World Cup. This performance was not enough, though, with a Rohit Sharma century leading India into the semi-finals at their opponents\\' expense.\\n==== Week 6 ====\\nThe final round started with England taking on New Zealand, with the winner guaranteed a semi-final position. Another Jonny Bairstow hundred saw England win by 119 runs and qualify for the semi-finals for the first time since 1992. After the West Indies won the dead rubber against Afghanistan at Leeds, Pakistan needed to win their final match against Bangladesh by a record margin of over 300 runs at Lord\\'s. They won, but only by 94 runs, allowing New Zealand to take the fourth and final semi-final berth. Despite Bangladesh losing the match, Shakib Al Hasan finished his tournament with 606 runs, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar\\'s record for the most runs in the group stage of a World Cup. Shakib\\'s record would very soon be surpassed by Rohit Sharma and David Warner by the end of the group stage, with former top-scoring in the group stage with 647 runs.The final two matches of the group stage were played on the Saturday to determine who would finish top of the group. At Leeds, India cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka off the back of centuries from K. L. Rahul and Rohit Sharma as they chased down a target of 265 runs with seven wickets to spare. Angelo Mathews scored his third ODI century for Sri Lanka, all of which had come against India. With South Africa defeating Australia by 10 runs, India finished top, sending Australia to a semi-final against England. A century from Faf du Plessis and a further 95 from Rassie van der Dussen saw South Africa set the Australians a target of 326. In response, Australia lost Usman Khawaja early on to a hamstring injury; he later returned but was dismissed for 18, before being ruled out for the rest of the tournament. David Warner scored 122, his third century of the tournament, and Alex Carey scored a career-best 85 but crucial wickets in the middle of the innings gave South Africa the victory by only 10 runs.\\n=== Fixtures ===\\nThe ICC released the fixture details on 26 April 2018.\\n== Knockout stage ==\\nThe knockout stage started with semi-finals at Old Trafford and Edgbaston, the winners of each progressing to the final at Lord\\'s. All three knockout games were allotted a reserve day. If a reserve day came into play, the match would not be restarted but instead resumed from the previous day\\'s play, if there was any. In the event of no play on the scheduled day or the reserve day, in the semi-finals, the team that finished higher in the group stage progressed to the final, and if no play were possible in the final, the trophy would be shared. If any match ended in a tie, a Super Over would be used to determine the winner; each team would select three batsmen and a bowler, with the full team available to field. There would be no penalty for the loss of a wicket, but the loss of two wickets would end the Super Over. If the scores in the Super Over were also tied, the winner would be determined by the two teams\\' overall boundary count, including both the match itself and the Super Over.On 25 June 2019, Australia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals after beating England at Lord\\'s. India became the second team to qualify after they defeated Bangladesh at Edgbaston on 2 July 2019. The following day saw tournament hosts England become the third team to qualify after they beat New Zealand at the Riverside Ground. New Zealand were the fourth and final team to qualify for the semi-finals after Pakistan were unable to increase their net run rate sufficiently enough in their match against Bangladesh at Lord\\'s.The first semi-final was played between India and New Zealand at Old Trafford, while the second semi-final was played between Australia and England at Edgbaston.\\n=== Semi-finals ===\\nThe first semi-final between India and New Zealand was played at Old Trafford in Manchester. Batting first, New Zealand lost opener Martin Guptill in the fourth over, having scored just one run. However, the Indians found wickets hard to come by after that, as Kane Williamson combined with Henry Nicholls and Ross Taylor for partnerships of 68 and 65 respectively. Williamson managed 67 runs before he was the third man out in the 36th over, a score matched by Taylor when rain stopped play in the 47th over with New Zealand at 211/5 following the wickets of Neesham and De Grandhomme. No further play was possible on the day, so the match went into its reserve day. Taylor managed another seven runs to top-score for the Kiwis, who managed to get the score to 239/8 at the end of their 50 overs. The Indian chase got off to a poor start with India falling to 5/3 in the fourth over, with the top three batsmen all going for one run each, then 24/4 after 10 overs. After a small partnership of 47 runs for the fifth wicket between Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja was joined by MS Dhoni for a century partnership for the seventh wicket that left India needing 37 runs from the final three overs; however, a late-order collapse saw New Zealand take the last four wickets for just 13 runs, sending them into their second consecutive World Cup final.The second semi-final saw England take on Australia at Edgbaston. Australia won the toss and chose to bat first, but lost three of their top four batsmen for single-figure scores, two of them to Chris Woakes, to reduce them to 14/3 into the seventh over. Wicket-keeper Alex Carey was promoted up the order due to his recent form, and, after getting his helmet knocked off by a Jofra Archer bouncer, he scored 46 before being caught by Adil Rashid. As wickets continued to tumble at the other end, Steve Smith held his wicket to top-score with 85 as Australia were bowled out for 223 with Woakes and Rashid being the best of the bowlers with three wickets apiece. England took their time to get going in the run chase but were soon making progress, reaching 124 before Jonny Bairstow was trapped LBW by Starc for the first wicket. Quick-hitting Jason Roy went two overs later to a controversial decision, caught behind off a bouncer that appeared not to touch his bat, but England had already used their review on Bairstow\\'s wicket, and Roy departed for 85 off just 65 balls, including five sixes. Nevertheless, England were well over halfway to their target by this point, and an unbroken partnership of 79 between Joe Root and captain Eoin Morgan saw them home to an eight-wicket victory and their first World Cup final since 1992.\\n=== Final ===\\nAfter New Zealand won the toss and chose to bat first, Henry Nicholls\\' first half-century of the tournament and a further 47 from wicket-keeper Tom Latham helped the Kiwis to a total of 241/8 from their 50 overs, as Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett each secured three wickets for the hosts. Defending a middling score, the New Zealand bowlers bowled effectively, hampering England\\'s top order, with only Jonny Bairstow managing more than a start with 36. With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over, however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught on 59. However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two dot balls, Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder\\'s throw deflected off Stokes\\' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the Laws of Cricket saying only one of the batsmen\\'s runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in. The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84*.With the scores tied, the match went to a Super Over. England returned Stokes and Buttler to the crease, and they handled Trent Boult\\'s bowling to accumulate 15 runs without loss. For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After Archer steady accumulation of runs which included a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery. Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy\\'s throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England\\'s superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand\\'s 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time after three previous final defeats in 1979, 1987 and 1992. Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be \"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life\", and later said England\\'s first World Cup victory was \"written in the stars\".\\n== Statistics ==\\n=== Most runs ===\\n=== Most wickets ===\\n=== Team of the tournament ===\\nThe ICC announced its team of the tournament on 15 July 2019 with Kane Williamson being named as player of the tournament and captain of the team.\\n== Broadcasting ==\\nThe ICC agreed deals for broadcast and digital distribution on a range of platforms, including television, radio and online streaming. The in-house ICC TV served as host broadcasters of the world feed, in collaboration with Sunset+Vine (as part of a new long-term agreement covering all ICC events, excluding the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup in India).In the United Kingdom, live coverage of the tournament was exclusive to pay television service Sky Sports, with free-to-air highlights packages sub-licensed to Channel 4. Sky later agreed to sub-license a simulcast of the final to Channel 4 if England reached the final. Sky Sport (New Zealand) also decided to air the final on its co-owned free-to-air channel Prime.Hotstar held digital rights to the tournament in India and several other markets. Hotstar surpassed 100 million daily users during the group match between India and Pakistan, and reached a record 25.3 million concurrent viewers during the semi-final between India and New Zealand.\\n== Notes ==\\n== References ==\\n== External links ==\\nICC Cricket World Cup 2019 Playing Conditions, International Cricket Council\\nTournament home at ESPNcricinfo'"
