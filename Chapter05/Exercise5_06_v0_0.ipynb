These data are used to estimate a total factor productivity (TFP) index for Canadian agriculture, which is the ratio of total gross output to total input, where both output and input are constant dollar implicit quantities. Average growth in the TFP index, referred to as TFP growth, can be estimated using a variety of methods; the growth rate reported in AAFC publications is estimated using OLS.\\n\\nFurther documentation provided in AAFC_PACA.odt</td>\n",

The data are defined at the national level only – i.e. for the whole of Canada. These data are used to estimate a total factor productivity (TFP) index for Canadian agriculture, which is the ratio of total gross output to total input, where both output and input are constant dollar implicit quantities. Average growth in the TFP index, referred to as TFP growth, can be estimated using a variety of methods; the growth rate reported in AAFC publications is estimated using OLS.\\n\\nFurther documentation provided in AAFC_PACA.odt   \n",

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.

Previous studies have shown that mercury and perfluorinated chemicals are carried into Arctic lakes during spring melt and are taken up and concentrated through the food web into char. This research examined food web accumulation of mercury, which has both natural and human sources and undergoes complex transformations in lakes, and of perfluorinated chemicals, which are entirely human-made, arrive solely by atmospheric deposition, and are not transformed in the environment. We built on previous research by contrasting how these two persistent contaminants concentrate through lake food webs and examining factors that affect their levels in char and other organisms in High Arctic lakes.

One objective of this project is to establish current concentrations of priority pollutants so future concentrations can be compared.  Marine traffic, mining and oil/gas exploration is expected to increase in the archipelago and could impact levels of contaminants in air and water.  Some of these pollutants include flame retardants, pesticides and chemicals released when burning fuels.  \\nSome local sources of these chemicals in the Arctic are from diesel burning for electricity (diesel is burned in Nunavut’s 25 hamlets to produce electricity), diesel burning ships, local oil exploration, forest fires and long range transport from southern regions.  As other long-lived pollutants decline due to regulations, chemicals from fuel burning may become a more important pollutant in the arctic environment.\\nAnother important set of chemicals in the arctic are flame retardants, they are receiving increased attention due to their presence in the arctic environment.  Flame retardants are used mainly in furniture, foam, textiles and fire resistant coatings but some are also used in plastics, hydraulic fluids, lacquer/paint, glue and cosmetics.  As some flame retardants are banned, the use of other flame retardants will increase. The goal of this work is to determine how existing and new long-lived pollutants are transported to the arctic, what happens to them once they are there, and how they enter the food web.  We propose to achieve this through air and water sampling in the Canadian Archipelago in collaboration with the ArcticNet program onboard the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Amundsen.  Please see Figure 1 for the ship’s cruise track.  This study will build on air and water investigations conducted by the same team since 1992 but looking at a broader range of chemicals. \\nNew to the project this year are brominated product compounds (BPCs).  They are naturally occurring but are also degradation products of brominated anthropogenic compounds such as poly brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). These compounds are present in arctic biota and the brominated dioxins have toxicological significance. Additionally, these are potential climate change indicators, since the retreat of sea ice, changes in precipitation and river runoff is predicted to change the distribution of these brominated compounds due to changes in primary production, species composition, circulation patterns, formation of the water column structure, load of dissolved organic matter and air-sea exchange. We propose to collect water, air and sediment samples for these compounds since little is known about their presence in the arctic abiotic environment. \\n\\nResults of this research, combined with those from earlier studies, will allow us to assess changes in pollutant levels in the Canadian Archipelago over time.  Our monitoring work helps us determine the effectiveness of Canadian and international regulations to reduce emissions of certain long-lived pollutants.  Our work also helps us understand how a changing climate influences how these chemicals move in the environment.  The information we collect on levels of new chemicals in Arctic air and water, including new flame retardants, will be used to determine whether or not they should be banned world-wide.\"\\n154,The “Agri-Environmental Indicator (AEI) - Risk of Water Contamination by Nitrogen (IROWC-N)” dataset estimates the level of risk of inorganic nitrogen contaminating surface water on Soil Landscapes of Canada agricultural areas for census years from 1981 to 2011.\\n10141,This table is part of a series of tables that present a portrait of Canada based on the various census topics.

The analysis is based on precipitation and temperature values interpolated every 10 km using the ANUSPLIN method, based on data from the Ministère du Développement durable, de l\\'Environnement et des Parcs du Québec and from Environment Canada.Evapotranspiration corresponds to the loss of water from the soil and plant cover by evaporation, and the loss of water from plants through transpiration.The potential evapotranspiration index (ETP) is based on the principle that the growth of a crop is optimal when the usable water reserve is sufficient and there is a balance between water absorbed by the roots and water lost through transpiration. The ETP corresponds to the maximum theoretical possible evaporation and transpiration in given climate conditions. The accumulated difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (P-ETP) gives a general indication of the “climatological” water balance and can be used to make qualitative comparisons between regions in terms of irrigation requirements and risks of drought.

Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade.

Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada.

Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada. Holders of export authorizations report monthly on their export activities to the Board.\"\\n1785,\"This dataset contains information on the biology and production of salmonids and limnological data for numerous lakes on the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland.

Processing of the time series was designed to reduce the occurrence of false change between maps. The method was based on change updating as described in Pouliot et al. (2011, 2013). Change detection accounted for both abrupt changes such as forest harvesting and more gradual changes such as recurrent insect defoliation. To determine the new label for a pixel identified as change, an evidential reasoning approach was used to combine spectral and contextual information. The 2005 MODIS land cover of Canada at 250 m spatial resolution described in Latifovic et al. (2012) was used as the base map. It contains 39 land cover classes, which for time series development was considered too detailed and was reduced to 25 and 19 class versions. The 25 class version corresponds to the North America Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS) Level 2 legend as described in Latifovic et al. (2012). Accuracy assessment of time series is difficult due to the need to assess many maps.

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.  These polygons identify sponge grounds from the broader distribution of sponges in the Southern Gulf region as sampled by Western II A gear in the Gulf biogeographic zone.

Based on counts conducted in Index Areas distributed throughout the province, the trend observed in the Strait of Georgia appears to be indicative of harbour seal populations throughout British Columbia. Total abundance of harbour seals on the B.C. coast in 2008 was estimated to be on the order of about 105,000 (95% confidence interval of 90,900 to 118,900) seals. Historic reconstructions indicate the population was depleted by a period of commercial harvesting during 1879-1914, and subsequently maintained below natural levels by predator control programs until the early 1960s.

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.  These polygons identify sponge grounds from the broader distribution of sponges in the Northern Gulf region as sampled by Campelen gear in the Gulf biogeographic zone. A 2 kg minimum threshold for the sponge catch was identified as the weight that separated the sponge ground habitat from the broader distribution of sponges with these research vessel tow data and gear type.\"\\n7057,\"Consulting services, operating expenses, by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)\"\\n4076,\"Loganberries, cranberries and blueberries, production and value\"\\n7391,\"Income of immigrants, by sex, landing age group, immigrant admission category, years since landing and landing year, for Alberta, 2013 constant dollars\"\\n10347,\"The Road Network File is a digital representation of Canada\\'s road network, containing information such as street names, types, directions and address ranges. \"\\n9757,\"Major wage settlements, by major industry division\"\\n7945,\"Adult criminal courts, guilty cases by length of probation\"\\n2384,Number and amount of benefits paid in countries with which Canada has concluded a Social Security Agreement to people who have lived or worked in another country.\\n7851,\"Postsecondary graduates, by Pan-Canadian Standard Classification of Education (PCSCE), Classification of Instructional Programs, Primary Grouping (CIP_PG), sex and student status\"\\n6874,\"Survey of innovation, selected service industries, degree of novelty of the most innovative process\"\\n2141,\"Ground level ozone was measured at the Alert, Nunavut research station (82º28’N, 62º30’W) from January 1992 to 2010.

Observations started at the Pacific Biological Station (Departure Bay) in 1914, 11 stations were added in the mid-1930s and several more in the 1960s. The number of stations reporting at any given time has varied as sampling has been discontinued at some stations, and started or resumed at others. Presently termed the British Columbia Shore Station Oceanographic Program (BCSOP), there are 13 participating stations. Most of the stations are at lighthouses staffed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, but three (Race Rocks, Amphitrite Point, and Active Pass) are sampled by contracted observers. This collection includes data from the Lighthouse sampling stations that are presently active or were sampled quite recently. Warning The daily sampling strategy at the BC Lighthouse Stations was designed long ago by Dr. John P. Tully. We have chosen not to change the strategy in the interests of a homogeneous data set. Sampling occurs at or near the daytime high tide. This means, for example, that if an observer starts sampling one day at 6 a.m.(local time), and continues to sample at the daytime hightide, as instructed, then on the 2nd day he/she will take samples at about 06:50 the next day, 07:40 the day after etc. When the daytime high tide gets close to 6 p.m. then it snaps back to 6 a.m. and the cycle starts again. Since there is a diurnal signal in sea-surface temperature the sampling creates a 14-day signal as an artifact.\"\\n9259,Enterprises holding or using issued patents in December 2010 that applied for patents in 2010\\n3555,\"The Centre for Biosecurity issues a Pathogen and Toxin Licence document to organizations conducting controlled activities with human pathogens or toxins under the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act and/or importing pure cultures of terrestrial animal pathogens and toxins, with exception of non-indigenous animal pathogens and pathogens causing emerging animal disease under the Health of Animals Regulations.

Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada.

The phytoplankton and zooplankton samples investigation will allow quantification of the above compounds in the lower food web and observe how these compounds move from the abiotic to biotic environment.  \\nFour OPs, tri-phenyl phosphate (TPP); tris-(2-chloro ethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris-(2-chloro propyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris-(1,2-dichloro propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) were identified in air samples for the first time in Canadian arctic air and levels are very high compared to levels of S-PBDEs and other brominated flame retardants at Alert (Xiao et al., 2012).  Due to these findings, archive samples from Alert and previous ArcticNet cruises were also analysed for OPs, thus establishing baseline concentrations in Canadian arctic air in which future trends can be compared.\"\\n406,\"The Drought Impact Label dataset is used on all drought polygons from D1 to D4 to specify the longitude and magnitude of impacts.

Introduction - The West Coast Haida Gwaii (WCHG) synoptic bottom trawl survey was first conducted annually from 2006 to 2008 and has since been repeated every second year on even numbered years. This survey is one of a set of long-term and coordinated surveys that together cover the continental shelf and upper slope of most of the British Columbia coast. The other surveys are the Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) survey, the Hecate Strait (HS) survey, the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) survey, and the Strait of Georgia (SOG) survey. The objectives of these surveys are to provide fishery independent abundance indices of all demersal fish species available to bottom trawling and to collect biological samples of selected species. The survey follows a random depth-stratified design and the sampling units are 2 km by 2 km blocks. The synoptic bottom trawl surveys are conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in collaboration with the Canadian Groundfish Research and Conservation Society (CGRCS), a non-profit society composed of participants in the British Columbia commercial groundfish trawl fishery. The Queen Charlotte Sound and West Coast Haida Gwaii surveys are conducted under collaborative agreements, with the CGRCS providing chartered commercial fishing vessels and field technicians, while DFO provides in-kind contributions for running the surveys including personnel and equipment. The Hecate Strait, West Coast Vancouver Island, and Strait of Georgia surveys are conducted by DFO and have typically taken place on the Canadian Coast Guard research vessel W.E. Ricker. In years when the W.E. Ricker has not been available, the Hecate Strait and West Coast Vancouver Island surveys have taken place on chartered industry vessels. Effort - This table contains information about the survey trips and fishing events (trawl tows/sets) that are part of this survey series. Trip-level information includes the year the survey took place, a unique trip identifier, the vessel that conducted the survey, and the trip start and end dates (the dates the vessel was away from the dock conducting the survey). Set-level information includes the date, time, location, and depth that fishing took place, as well as information that can be used to calculate fishing effort (duration) and swept area. All successful fishing events are included, regardless of what was caught. Catch - This table contains the catch information from successful fishing events. Catches are identified to species or to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Most catches are weighed, but some are too small (“trace” amounts) or too large (e.g. very large Big Skate). The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that catches can be related to the fishing event information (including capture location). Biology - This table contains the available biological data for catches which were sampled. Data may include any or all of length, sex, weight, age. Different length types are measured depending on the species. Age structures are collected when possible for species where validated aging methods exist and are archived until required for an assessment; therefore, all existing structures have not been aged at this time. The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that samples can be related to the fishing event and catch information. Biomass - This table contains relative biomass indices of species that have been captured in every survey of the time series. The coefficient of variation and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are provided for each index. The report on the 2012 Strait of Georgia Survey (King et al. 2013) provides an explanation of how the relative indices are derived. Note that we do not calculate a biomass index for the 2014 West Coast Haida Gwaii survey, as this survey was incomplete due to operational problems.\"\\n1899,\"Whelk catch and biological data (sampled weight, shell height, sex) collected by the dockside monitoring program of commercial catches in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence since 1987.\"\\n1869,Catch data of American lobsters of all sizes collected on 50m long transects on a nursery ground in the Magdalen Islands since 1995.\\n6298,\"Industrial product price indexes, by industry and industry group\"\\n7824,Exchange rates\\n2090,This database contains detailed information on various sorbents (materials used to absorb chemicals) with a particular emphasis on the compunds abilities to absorb oil from tanker spills.\\n10222,Provides a statistical overview of various geographic areas based on a number of detailed variables.\\n7188,\"Sheep statistics, supply and disposition of sheep and lambs\"\\n6428,\"Births, by sex, Canada, provinces and territories\"\\n5410,\"Business credit outstanding, by supplier type and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)\"\\n1540,\"Atlantic Salmon biological sampling from various projects in both the marine and freshwater environment.

The GSC played a relatively passive role, but had a fundamental role in the early days of the consortium\\'s over 30 year history. The amalgamation of oil companies and decline in supporting subscriptions led to the dissolution of PALYNODATA Inc. in 2007. To maintain accessibility of the PALYNODATA database, the GSC agreed to take over, house and provide public access to the database. The PALYNODATA database is the largest database of its kind in the world. The data is the result of abstracting from over 22,000 publications, and includes biostratigraphic, taxonomic, bibliographic and paleogeographic information.

Aquaculture licence conditions set out mandatory monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure any impacts are appropriately mitigated at salmon farms. A central component of on-farm fish health management is a Fish Health Management Plan (FHMP). FHMPs are approved by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and describe the fish health principles that the licensee must follow to maintain fish health and biosecurity at the farm. Licence holders must routinely submit a variety of fish health data to DFO. Routine reports include information on mortality rates, including the suspected cause of mortality. Additional reports are submitted if there are elevated mortalities or a fish health event that requires the involvement of a veterinarian. Both DFO and aquaculture companies have veterinarians on staff (or available on contract, for some companies) to monitor fish health on farms. Company veterinarians ensure appropriate husbandry in day-to-day operations and identify appropriate management measures if fish health concerns arise. Through the Fish Health Audit and Surveillance program, DFO oversees the health of cultured salmon to minimize fish health and disease risks to wild and farmed fish and publishes reports on regulation and monitoring of BC’s marine finfish aquaculture facilities. Sites are routinely inspected to ensure compliance with FHMPs, to verify the accuracy of industry reporting, and to collect samples for routine diagnostic disease screening. All salmon aquaculture transfers require authorization under section 56 of the Fishery (General) Regulations. Movements of fish to and from farms may be required to introduce new stock, facilitate growth at different life stages or optimize production. DFO reviews these applications to determine whether the movement may adversely affect local aquatic species and habitats. DFO veterinarians and biologists assess the information gathered by DFO and submitted by industry to gain a complete picture of the health status of the fish to be moved. For hatchery to marine transfers, this assessment also includes an in-depth records review and on-site inspection of the fish. If this assessment indicates that a pathogen or disease is affecting the fish to be transferred, DFO may place restrictions on the movement and/or prescribe additional conditions to mitigate any risk of disease transmission, such as grading to remove undersized fish, the use of pre-transfer medications, or additional post-transfer health testing. If no mitigation measure can be identified, the application will be denied.\"\\n3030,\"The Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM) is part of Natural Resources Canada\\'s altimetry system designed to better meet the users\\' needs for elevation data and products.

Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada.

The effect that such conditions may have on fathead minnow development has yet to be explicitly described. Here we compared rates of embryonic development in fathead minnow embryos reared under standard light and temperature conditions with a range of possible methods. All methods yielded excellent control survival.  We demonstrated that fathead minnow embryos incubated in a range of small volumes in multi-well plates (500 μL to 2 mL per embryo) did not substantially vary in developmental rate, but flexed less frequently as embryos, hatched smaller, later and with larger yolk-sacs, and initiated feeding later than embryos reared in an excess of solution (20 mL per embryo) with or without supplemental aeration. Faster hatch and growth were promoted with an orbital shaker, but growth benefits were not sustained into the larval stage.  Developmental differences persisted in larvae reared to 20 days post-fertilization when monitoring ceased, but growth differences did not magnify and in some measurements partially resolved. To our knowledge we are the first to report effects of incubation in multi-well plates in any fish taxa. As our data revealed that the eleutheroembryonic stage for fathead minnow may be prolonged in multi-well plates, this may allow the use of longer toxicity tests using fathead minnow embryos without conflicting with existing animal welfare legislation in many countries.\\n\\nThe data file presents the individual length and weight to each fathead minnow fry at hatch.\"\\n10258,This table is part of a series of tables that present a portrait of Canada based on the various census topics.

The minimum period is from one winter, through the following summer, and into the next winter; however, most permafrost has existed for much longer. This formal definition considers only the temperature of the ground, and thus permafrost is a strictly thermal phenomenon, and not a material. At temperatures below 0° C , almost all of the soil moisture occurs in the form of ground ice. Ground ice usually exists at temperature close to its melting point and so is liable to melt if the ground warms.

Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan; although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada.

Measurements were made while the mobile laboratories were driven downwind of oil production facilities in the region on a daily basis, starting approximately 0900 and ending approximately 1700 local time (CST).  The objectives of these measurements included 1) scouting the Bakken shale plays in southern Saskatchewan, to determine whether petroleum resource development releases air pollutants to the atmosphere, 2) to determine the emission rates of CACs (NOx, SO2, CO, VOCs), GHG/SLCP (CO2, CH4, black carbon), and air toxics (H2S, aromatics) from these development activities and 3) to provide data that can be used in emission inventory development.

The survey consisted of approximately 790 square kilometers of coverage. While collecting the LiDAR data, we also acquired aerial photo in RGB and NIR modes consisting of 1649 frames each.In addition to the main area of interest, McElhanney has acquired some LiDAR and photo of low lying areas adjacent to the project area. This additional area was acquired on speculation that the data may be required in the future.The 3Dimensional laser returns (point cloud) were classified using Microstation (v8), Terrascan and TerraModeler. A series of algorithms based on topography were created to separate laser returns that hit the ground from the ones that hit objects above the ground.Steps taken are:Classified LiDAR surface as Bare earth, Classified other features as non-bare earth or default, Formatted to ASPRS .LAS V1.1 (Class 1 - Default (non-bare earth), Class 2 – Ground points (bare earth)), 239 tiles each 2km x2km generated for LiDAR data, File prefix FF – Classified (Non-Bare Earth and Bare Earth), File Prefix BE – Bare Earth only, Bare Earth Model Key Point (MKPts) surface files are thinned Bare earth LiDAR points.

The main body of the publication consists of a series of statistical tables and charts covering the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015.\\n In Facts & Figures 2015 for Temporary Residents, numbers on International Mobility Program (IMP) Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes increased due to the moving of the Post-graduate Employment Work Permit Holders population from Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes to Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes under the International Mobility Program. As a result of this, the Facts & Figures 2015 reports reflect a corresponding decrease in the number of Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. These changes have been applied retroactively.\\n The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Skilled Canadian work experience gained through the PGWPP potentially helps graduates qualify for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). \\n\\nFacts & Figures 2013 had previously counted those who held Post-Graduation Work Permits as Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. However, Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes is a category for individuals who are primarily students and who are also allowed to get a work permit (e.g., Co-op students) because it is integral to their course of studies. To get a PGWP, in contrast, an individual must have ceased to be a student – it is a requirement that the individual must have graduated from their program.\"\\n4501,\"Survey of innovation, logging and manufacturing industries, percentage of innovative plants using sources of information that provided information for new innovation projects\"\\n7867,\"Merchandise imports and exports customs-based price indexes, Canada and United States trade, and Standard International Trade Classification (SITC revision 3) price indexes for all countries and United States\"\\n10815,\"\"\"Communities benefitting\"\" include all distinct communities receiving benefit from a new or improved infrastructure system, network, or facility.

The analysis is based on precipitation and temperature values interpolated every 10 km using the ANUSPLIN method, based on data from the Ministère du Développement durable, de l\\'Environnement et des Parcs du Québec and from Environment Canada.Evapotranspiration corresponds to the loss of water from the soil and plant cover by evaporation, and the loss of water from plants through transpiration.The potential evapotranspiration index (ETP) is based on the principle that the growth of a crop is optimal when the usable water reserve is sufficient and there is a balance between water absorbed by the roots and water lost through transpiration. The ETP corresponds to the maximum theoretical possible evaporation and transpiration in given climate conditions. The accumulated difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (P-ETP) gives a general indication of the “climatological” water balance and can be used to make qualitative comparisons between regions in terms of irrigation requirements and risks of drought. However, a specific assessment of water needs for a given culture and a specific location requires knowledge of the actual evapotranspiration which, in addition to climatological factors, also takes into account the characteristics of the plant and the soil.\"\\n6328,\"Arthritis/rheumatism, by age group and sex, household population aged 12 and over, territories\"\\n140,The “Agri-Environmental Indicator (AEI) - Agricultural Particulate Matter Emissions (APMEI) – Particulate Matter less than 10 μm (PM 10)” dataset provides estimated net emissions of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 micrometers (including less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5)) from agricultural lands for census years 1981 to 2011.\\n1559,\"Survey for Physella wright - the hotwater physa, at Liard River Hotsprings Provincial Park, August 2006.\"\\n410,\"The ‘Land use allocation to Soils and Landforms by year’ dataset links agricultural land use activities to soils and landscapes within Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) polygons.

Further information on the CRMN network is available at: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/contaminants/radiation/crmn-rcsr/index-eng.php. The results provided are activity concentration and uncertainty for various nuclides in the months following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. Reported are the naturally occurring radionuclides: beryllium-7 (7Be) and lead-210 (210Pb), and all anthropogenic radionuclides observed: cesium-134 (134Cs), cesium-136 (136Cs), cesium-137 (137Cs), iodine-131 (131I), iodine-132 (132I), iodine-133 (133I), tellurium-129 (129Te), tellurium-129m (129mTe), tellurium-132 (132Te), technetium-99m (99mTc), lanthanum-140 (140La), and the radioactive gases: xenon-131m (131mXe), xenon-133 (133Xe), xenon-133m (133mXe), and xenon-135 (135Xe). The absence of data for a specific nuclide indicates that it was either below the detection threshold or absent. The data comes from the measurement and analysis of particulates accumulated in filter media or from xenon gas extracted from the atmosphere. Cascade summations corrections were applied to ensure reporting of the true physical relationships among the observed radionuclides. Throughout the accident period, the measured activity concentrations of all radionuclides represent only a small fraction of the typical annual background exposure from natural sources of radiation.

Please consult the meta-data text file that accompanies the zip file download for the figure on the data usage policy and appropriate citation. The meta-data file also provides field descriptors and any other information that may be useful in interpreting the data provided in relation to the accompanying imagery. Abstract: Ocean conditions were unusually warm and stratified on the Scotian Shelf in 2012, and the plankton response to the physical environment in 2012 set the initial conditions for the plankton in 2013. In particular, zooplankton biomass and the abundance of the two dominant herbivorous copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp., were low, and there appeared to be a shift to a smaller-size phytoplankton community on the Scotian Shelf. In 2013, annual average temperature anomalies were still positive in the Maritimes Region, but less so than in 2012, and temperature and stratification anomalies were marked by strong sub-annual and mesoscale variability. Variability in the physical environment was reflected in nutrient and plankton conditions. Annual average deep-water and winter surface nitrate inventories were similar to average overall, but surface nitrate was higher than average. The magnitude of the spring bloom chlorophyll peak was above average on the Eastern Scotian Shelf (ESS) and below average on the Western Scotian Shelf (WSS) and in the eastern Gulf of Maine, but summer-fall blooms were above average in all areas. Zooplankton biomass and abundance were lower than average on the eastern transects, but anomalies were mixed on the Central Scotian Shelf, ESS and Bay of Fundy. The abundance of Pseudocalanus spp. was higher than average in the central and western part of the region. Although C. finmarchicus abundance was variable and lower than average overall, it was high on the WSS and in the eastern Gulf of Maine during the summer ecosystem trawl survey and higher than average at the Halifax-2 station and in Emerald Basin in autumn, suggesting a return to more typical abundances in the western part of the region at the end of 2013. Similar to the broader Scotian Shelf, the 2013 Bedford Basin annual average temperature was warmer than normal but not as warm as 2012. Small phytoplankton were more abundant than average in Bedford Basin and large phytoplankton less abundant. An initial evaluation of relationships among annual anomalies of physical variables, nitrate, spring bloom metrics and zooplankton at Halifax-2 from 1999 to 2013 identified bloom duration and enhanced upwelling as important correlates of zooplankton biomass and dominant copepod abundance at an annual scale. Continuous Plankton Recorder sampling showed that observations of phytoplankton bloom dynamics and abundance of C. finmarchicus at Halifax-2 in 2012 were representative of shelf-wide patterns. http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2014/2014_104-eng.html\"\\n3762,\"At the end of each fiscal year, financial information is published in the Public Accounts.

Therefore, where higher velocity (e.g. clay) layers may overlie lower velocity (e.g. sand or gravel) layers, seismic refraction may yield incorrect results. In addition, since seismic refraction requires geophone arrays with lengths of approximately 4 to 5 times the depth to the density contrast of interest (e.g. the top of bedrock), seismic refraction is commonly limited (as a matter of practicality) to mapping layers only where they occur at depths less than 100 feet.\"\\n1069,The indicator represents the total number of food services grievances that were upheld (i.e. with a final grievance decision of UPHELD) per total number of food services grievances submitted.  \\n8724,The Aboriginal Population Profile presents information on the Aboriginal identity population from the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS). \\n5234,\"Net worth of family units, by selected family characteristics\"\\n3241,\"The Canadian Base Network is designed to serve as the ground segment of monumented survey control in the Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS).

Beginning with the 2011 growing season, this activity has been extended to other provinces in support of a national crop inventory.

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.  These polygons identify sea pen fields from the broader distribution of sea pens in the Northern Gulf region as sampled by Campelen trawl gear in the Gulf biogeographic zone. A 7 kg minimum threshold for the sea pen catch was identified as the weight that separated the sea pen field habitat from the broader distribution of sea pens with these research vessel tow data and gear type.\"\\n8440,This table is part of a series of tables that present a portrait of Canada based on the various census topics.

This analysis was based on temperature values interpolated at 10 km using the ANUSPLIN method, based on data from the Ministère du Développement durable, de l\\'Environnement et des Parcs du Québec and from Environment Canada.The water inflow provided by precipitation is an index used in a number of production sectors, to manage plot irrigation, evaluation of the agricultural potential of a given region and leaching of pesticides, for example. Accumulated precipitation in the form of rain can be calculated on an annual or monthly basis or over a specific period: for example, from April to October to correspond generally with the growing season. Quantities of rain are thus calculated for a selected territory on a variable time scale. It is important that careful attention be paid to the scale when interpreting the observed weather data. As an example, the accumulation of small quantities of rain on a regular basis over a long period may be equivalent to a higher amount of rain falling during a shorter period, but the impact on the crop is not the same.\"\\n8706,\"This table provides statistical information about people in Canada by their demographic, social and economic characteristics as well as provide information about the housing units in which they live.\"\\n8299,This table is part of a series of tables that present a portrait of Canada based on the various census topics.

The historical background radiation dose data can be found here: http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/dc69b741-bcd4-4e0c-a3d3-f25bf9f34f03. A transit dosimeter is sent along with the monitoring dosimeter to determine if there is a significant dose recorded by the dosimeter while it is in transit to the sampling station. The transit dosimeter is shipped out with a station monitor, and shipped back with the station monitor from the previous quarter. The monitoring dosimeters are deployed over a longer time (around three months) than the transit dosimeters (around 3 weeks). This difference largely explains the lower recorded dose values for the transit dosimeter. The results provided for the monitoring and transit dosimeters are expressed as absorbed dose calibrated with a cesium source in units of millisieverts (mSv). The accuracy of the dosimeters is estimated to be ± 15%. The external dose can be attributed almost exclusively to natural radiation (of terrestrial and cosmic origin) with fluctuations based on several factors including location, soil characteristics, and seasonal changes. \"\\n3979,\"Corporate short-term paper outstanding, Bank of Canada\"\\n1380,\"Digital photos of field work, specimens, work activities.\"\\n3560,This application is used by all federal departments requesting for their staff accommodation before taking a test.

Land Cover information is the result of vectorization of raster thematic data originating from classified Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 ortho-images, for agricultural and forest areas of Canada, and for Northern Territories. The forest cover was produced by the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development (EOSD) project, an initiative of the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) with the collaboration of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and in partnership with the provincial and territorial governments. The agricultural coverage is produced by the National Land and Water Information Service (NLWIS) of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). Northern Territories land cover was realized by the Canadian Centre of Remote Sensing (CCRS). Land Cover data are classified according to a harmonized legend build from the partner\\'s legends. This legend is principally based on the legend described in following publication: EOSD publication: EOSD Land Cover Classification Legend Report, on which CFS and AAFC collaborated. Some classes related to Northern environments where added in order to meet the interpretation of the Northern land cover classification experts. Land Cover vector data are closest as possible to the source (original raster data). Slight differences can occur because the raster data goes through a data portrayal before being vectorized in order to enhance visual representation such as minimum size, smoothness of polygons and geometry.\"\\n3805,\"The moment a department deposits money in a financial institution, the information is sent to the Bank of Canada and the Government Banking System (GBS).

The main body of the publication consists of a series of statistical tables and charts covering the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015.\\n In Facts & Figures 2015 for Temporary Residents, numbers on International Mobility Program (IMP) Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes increased due to the moving of the Post-graduate Employment Work Permit Holders population from Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes to Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes under the International Mobility Program. As a result of this, the Facts & Figures 2015 reports reflect a corresponding decrease in the number of Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. These changes have been applied retroactively.\\n The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Skilled Canadian work experience gained through the PGWPP potentially helps graduates qualify for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). \\n\\nFacts & Figures 2013 had previously counted those who held Post-Graduation Work Permits as Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. However, Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes is a category for individuals who are primarily students and who are also allowed to get a work permit (e.g., Co-op students) because it is integral to their course of studies. To get a PGWP, in contrast, an individual must have ceased to be a student – it is a requirement that the individual must have graduated from their program.\"\\n2002,\"The aircraft, ships, vehicles and weapons used by the Canadian Armed Forces in training and operations.

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.

Drinking water advisories are put in place for various reasons. For instance, a community may issue an advisory if there are problems in the overall water system, such as line breaks, equipment failure, or poor filtration/disinfection during water treatment.

Other authority codes (non-appropriated authorities) are also established by central agencies to facilitate the identification of various accounting transactions that do not require the use of appropriations. An appropriation is an authority of Parliament to pay money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) and as such, provides parliamentarians with control over most expenditures of the government. As a general rule, transactions are recorded against an appropriation on an expenditure basis; however, there are certain expenditures that are not charged to an appropriation until a payment is required. The authority code identify expenditures transactions as follows: Statutory expenditures Statutory expenditures are those that Parliament has approved through legislation (other than Appropriations Act) that set out the purpose of the expenditures and the terms and conditions under which they may be made. Non-statutory expenditures are those that Parliament approves annually through an Appropriation Act. Once approved the vote wording and the expenditure authority attributable to each vote become the governing conditions under which these expenditures may be made. Non-appropriated transactions Non-appropriated authority codes identify accounting transactions that do not require the use of appropriations (i.e., expenditure or revenue are already recognized [e.g., amortization expense or the receipt of revenue credited to vote] or expenditure is not charged to appropriations until the payment is required [e.g., severance pay]).\"\\n5864,\"Family characteristics, labour income profile, by family type\"\\n627,\"Temporary residents who are in Canada on a work permit or study permit in the observed calendar year.

Firstly, this study aimed to quantify summer CO2 and CH4 emissions for the full range of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the subarctic zone, more exactly in the Kuujjuarapik area, and to examine the importance of limnology, vegetation cover and underlying substrate on spatial variations in C emissions. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 were measured using a static flux chamber (SFC) and concentrations were determined by dual detector gas chromatography. These fluxes were then scaled by cover type to give a first estimate of this subarctic region\\'s landscape scale summer emissions of CO2 and CH4. Secondly, another objective of this research was to determine net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in the eastern Canadian subarctic ecosystems, more precisely over shrub vegetation in forest tundra, and to examine the implication of climatic factors, such as precipitation and temperature, on annual and seasonal variability. An open path Eddy Covariance System, including 3D anemometer, CO2/H2O open path infrared gas analyzer and specific meteorological sensors were used for continuous in situ measurements. Carbon dioxide exchanges were then compiled to give a first estimate of NEE budget of this subarctic region. Finally, we aimed to compare soil C content with the general trends of CO2 exchange along a gradient spanning 55° to 73°N in the Canadian eastern Arctic and to relate this to spatial trends in vegetation communities. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 over soil were measured using a static flux chamber (SFC) and concentrations were determined by dual detector gas chromatography and infrared analyzer.

Sound is transmitted toward the seabed in beams formed using an array of piezoelectric transducers and as the vessel moves through the water, the acoustic signals or \"\"pings\"\" bounce back off the seabed returning up to the water surface where they are detected by the transducer and recorded on board. Measurement of acoustic velocity variations in the water column permit conversion of  \"\"ping\"\" return time to water depth. Compilation and processing of these soundings within a Geographic Information System (GIS) yields a 3-dimensional digital elevation model (DEM) of the seafloor.

On December 8, 2006, the Government of Canada unveiled the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) which takes action regarding chemicals that are harmful to human health or the environment.  One element of the CMP is Monitoring and Surveillance, which generates data on the presence and levels of chemical substances in environmental matrices.  These data are used to make risk assessment and risk management decisions regarding the best approach to protect Canadians and their environment from risks these substances might pose.  \\n\\nThe wastewater sector has been identified as a possible release point to the environment for certain CMP substances.  The purpose of the wastewater monitoring program is to gather information from representative municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Canada to determine the levels of selected chemical substances (such as Bisphenol A, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, flame retardants, heavy metals, etc) entering WWTPs, the fate of these substances through various typical wastewater and sludge treatment processes (primary treatment, activated sludge treatment, lagoon treatment, etc.) at warm and cold process temperatures, and levels of these substances being discharged in WWTP effluents and solids residuals. The participation of various WWTPs in this program is done on a voluntary and anonymous basis, and sampling can only commence once a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed by the Municipality and Environment and Climate Change Canada.  The results from this monitoring project will be used to improve our understanding and prediction of the fate of chemical substances during wastewater treatment and to determine if control measures are needed to prevent these substances from entering the municipal wastewater system.\"\\n1624,Capelin larval information from plankton tows.

More information about the CRMN network can be found here: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/contaminants/radiation/crmn-rcsr/index-eng.php The results provided are for tritium activity concentration, expressed in units of becquerels per cubic meter (Bq/m3). Atmospheric water is sampled monthly for determination of tritium content. The majority of such monitoring activity occurs in close proximity to nuclear power plants. Until 1996, Health Canada monitored the areas near Darlington, Bruce and Pickering in Ontario, Gentilly in Quebec, and Point Lepreau in New Brunswick. In 1996, Health Canada’s monitoring of the Ontario stations was terminated to avoid redundancy, since a similar initiative was underway through the Ontario Ministry of Labour. Currently, the CRMN monitors six sites in the vicinity of Point Lepreau, four sites in the vicinity of Gentilly, and a single site in the Greater Toronto Area. The average tritium concentration for the CRMN stations is 0.22 Bq/m3 for the time period from 2004 to 2013. This is consistent with results reported for other monitoring stations in close proximity to Canadian nuclear power stations, and the levels are considered to be safe from a health perspective. Note that the tritium values are measured using liquid scintillator measurements. This requires removing the background contribution from the measurement.
