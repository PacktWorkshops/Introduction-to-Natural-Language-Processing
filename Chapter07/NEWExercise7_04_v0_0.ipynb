HENRY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot very long ago some one invented the assertion that there were\\nonly \"Four Hundred\" people in New York City who were really worth\\nnoticing. But a wiser man has arisen--the census taker--and his\\nlarger estimate of human interest has been preferred in marking out\\nthe field of these little stories of the \"Four Million.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\nTOBIN\\'S PALM\\nTHE GIFT OF THE MAGI\\nA COSMOPOLITE IN A CAFÃ‰\\nBETWEEN ROUNDS\\nTHE SKYLIGHT ROOM\\nA SERVICE OF LOVE\\nTHE COMING-OUT OF MAGGIE\\nMAN ABOUT TOWN\\nTHE COP AND THE ANTHEM\\nAN ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE\\nMEMOIRS OF A YELLOW DOG\\nTHE LOVE-PHILTRE OF IKEY SCHOENSTEIN\\nMAMMON AND THE ARCHER\\nSPRINGTIME Ã€ LA CARTE\\nTHE GREEN DOOR\\nFROM THE CABBY\\'S SEAT\\nAN UNFINISHED STORY\\nTHE CALIPH, CUPID AND THE CLOCK\\nSISTERS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE\\nTHE ROMANCE OF A BUSY BROKER\\nAFTER TWENTY YEARS\\nLOST ON DRESS PARADE\\nBY COURIER\\nTHE FURNISHED ROOM\\nTHE BRIEF DÃ‰BUT OF TILDY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTOBIN\\'S PALM\\n\\n\\nTobin and me, the two of us, went down to Coney one day, for there was\\nfour dollars between us, and Tobin had need of distractions. For there\\nwas Katie Mahorner, his sweetheart, of County Sligo, lost since she\\nstarted for America three months before with two hundred dollars, her\\nown savings, and one hundred dollars from the sale of Tobin\\'s inherited\\nestate, a fine cottage and pig on the Bog Shannaugh. And since the\\nletter that Tobin got saying that she had started to come to him not a\\nbit of news had he heard or seen of Katie Mahorner. Tobin advertised in\\nthe papers, but nothing could be found of the colleen.\\n\\nSo, to Coney me and Tobin went, thinking that a turn at the chutes and\\nthe smell of the popcorn might raise the heart in his bosom. But Tobin\\nwas a hardheaded man, and the sadness stuck in his skin. He ground his\\nteeth at the crying balloons; he cursed the moving pictures; and, though\\nhe would drink whenever asked, he scorned Punch and Judy, and was for\\nlicking the tintype men as they came.\\n\\nSo I gets him down a side way on a board walk where the attractions were\\nsome less violent. At a little six by eight stall Tobin halts, with a\\nmore human look in his eye.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis here,\" says he, \"I will be diverted. I\\'ll have the palm of me hand\\ninvestigated by the wonderful palmist of the Nile, and see if what is to\\nbe will be.\"\\n\\nTobin was a believer in signs and the unnatural in nature. He possessed\\nillegal convictions in his mind along the subjects of black cats, lucky\\nnumbers, and the weather predictions in the papers.\\n\\nWe went into the enchanted chicken coop, which was fixed mysterious with\\nred cloth and pictures of hands with lines crossing \\'em like a railroad\\ncentre. The sign over the door says it is Madame Zozo the Egyptian\\nPalmist. There was a fat woman inside in a red jumper with pothooks and\\nbeasties embroidered upon it. Tobin gives her ten cents and extends one\\nof his hands. She lifts Tobin\\'s hand, which is own brother to the hoof\\nof a drayhorse, and examines it to see whether \\'tis a stone in the frog\\nor a cast shoe he has come for.\\n\\n\"Man,\" says this Madame Zozo, \"the line of your fate shows--\"\\n\\n\"Tis not me foot at all,\" says Tobin, interrupting. \"Sure, \\'tis no\\nbeauty, but ye hold the palm of me hand.\"\\n\\n\"The line shows,\" says the Madame, \"that ye\\'ve not arrived at your\\ntime of life without bad luck. And there\\'s more to come. The mount\\nof Venus--or is that a stone bruise?--shows that ye\\'ve been in love.\\nThere\\'s been trouble in your life on account of your sweetheart.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis Katie Mahorner she has references with,\" whispers Tobin to me in a\\nloud voice to one side.\\n\\n\"I see,\" says the palmist, \"a great deal of sorrow and tribulation with\\none whom ye cannot forget. I see the lines of designation point to the\\nletter K and the letter M in her name.\"\\n\\n\"Whist!\" says Tobin to me, \"do ye hear that?\"\\n\\n\"Look out,\" goes on the palmist, \"for a dark man and a light woman; for\\nthey\\'ll both bring ye trouble. Ye\\'ll make a voyage upon the water very\\nsoon, and have a financial loss. I see one line that brings good luck.\\nThere\\'s a man coming into your life who will fetch ye good fortune.\\nYe\\'ll know him when ye see him by his crooked nose.\"\\n\\n\"Is his name set down?\" asks Tobin. \"\\'Twill be convenient in the way of\\ngreeting when he backs up to dump off the good luck.\"\\n\\n\"His name,\" says the palmist, thoughtful looking, \"is not spelled out by\\nthe lines, but they indicate \\'tis a long one, and the letter \\'o\\' should\\nbe in it. There\\'s no more to tell. Good-evening. Don\\'t block up the\\ndoor.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis wonderful how she knows,\" says Tobin as we walk to the pier.\\n\\nAs we squeezed through the gates a nigger man sticks his lighted segar\\nagainst Tobin\\'s ear, and there is trouble. Tobin hammers his neck, and\\nthe women squeal, and by presence of mind I drag the little man out of\\nthe way before the police comes. Tobin is always in an ugly mood when\\nenjoying himself.\\n\\nOn the boat going back, when the man calls \"Who wants the good-looking\\nwaiter?\" Tobin tried to plead guilty, feeling the desire to blow the\\nfoam off a crock of suds, but when he felt in his pocket he found\\nhimself discharged for lack of evidence. Somebody had disturbed his\\nchange during the commotion. So we sat, dry, upon the stools, listening\\nto the Dagoes fiddling on deck. If anything, Tobin was lower in spirits\\nand less congenial with his misfortunes than when we started.\\n\\nOn a seat against the railing was a young woman dressed suitable for red\\nautomobiles, with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum. In passing\\nby, Tobin kicks her foot without intentions, and, being polite to ladies\\nwhen in drink, he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising. But\\nhe knocks it off, and the wind carries it overboard.\\n\\nTobin came back and sat down, and I began to look out for him, for the\\nman\\'s adversities were becoming frequent. He was apt, when pushed so\\nclose by hard luck, to kick the best dressed man he could see, and try\\nto take command of the boat.\\n\\nPresently Tobin grabs my arm and says, excited: \"Jawn,\" says he, \"do ye\\nknow what we\\'re doing? We\\'re taking a voyage upon the water.\"\\n\\n\"There now,\" says I; \"subdue yeself. The boat\\'ll land in ten minutes\\nmore.\"\\n\\n\"Look,\" says he, \"at the light lady upon the bench. And have ye\\nforgotten the nigger man that burned me ear? And isn\\'t the money I had\\ngone--a dollar sixty-five it was?\"\\n\\nI thought he was no more than summing up his catastrophes so as to get\\nviolent with good excuse, as men will do, and I tried to make him\\nunderstand such things was trifles.\\n\\n\"Listen,\" says Tobin. \"Ye\\'ve no ear for the gift of prophecy or the\\nmiracles of the inspired. What did the palmist lady tell ye out of me\\nhand? \\'Tis coming true before your eyes. \\'Look out,\\' says she, \\'for a\\ndark man and a light woman; they\\'ll bring ye trouble.\\' Have ye forgot\\nthe nigger man, though he got some of it back from me fist? Can ye show\\nme a lighter woman than the blonde lady that was the cause of me hat\\nfalling in the water? And where\\'s the dollar sixty-five I had in me vest\\nwhen we left the shooting gallery?\"\\n\\nThe way Tobin put it, it did seem to corroborate the art of prediction,\\nthough it looked to me that these accidents could happen to any one at\\nConey without the implication of palmistry.\\n\\nTobin got up and walked around on deck, looking close at the passengers\\nout of his little red eyes. I asked him the interpretation of his\\nmovements. Ye never know what Tobin has in his mind until he begins to\\ncarry it out.\\n\\n\"Ye should know,\" says he, \"I\\'m working out the salvation promised by\\nthe lines in me palm. I\\'m looking for the crooked-nose man that\\'s to\\nbring the good luck. \\'Tis all that will save us. Jawn, did ye ever see\\na straighter-nosed gang of hellions in the days of your life?\"\\n\\n\\'Twas the nine-thirty boat, and we landed and walked up-town through\\nTwenty-second Street, Tobin being without his hat.\\n\\nOn a street corner, standing under a gas-light and looking over the\\nelevated road at the moon, was a man. A long man he was, dressed decent,\\nwith a segar between his teeth, and I saw that his nose made two twists\\nfrom bridge to end, like the wriggle of a snake. Tobin saw it at the\\nsame time, and I heard him breathe hard like a horse when you take the\\nsaddle off. He went straight up to the man, and I went with him.\\n\\n\"Good-night to ye,\" Tobin says to the man. The man takes out his segar\\nand passes the compliments, sociable.\\n\\n\"Would ye hand us your name,\" asks Tobin, \"and let us look at the size\\nof it? It may be our duty to become acquainted with ye.\"\\n\\n\"My name\" says the man, polite, \"is Friedenhausman--Maximus G.\\nFriedenhausman.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the right length,\" says Tobin. \"Do you spell it with an \\'o\\'\\nanywhere down the stretch of it?\"\\n\\n\"I do not,\" says the man.\\n\\n\"_Can_ ye spell it with an \\'o\\'?\" inquires Tobin, turning anxious.\\n\\n\"If your conscience,\" says the man with the nose, \"is indisposed toward\\nforeign idioms ye might, to please yourself, smuggle the letter into the\\npenultimate syllable.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis well,\" says Tobin. \"Ye\\'re in the presence of Jawn Malone and\\nDaniel Tobin.\"\\n\\n\"Tis highly appreciated,\" says the man, with a bow. \"And now since I\\ncannot conceive that ye would hold a spelling bee upon the street\\ncorner, will ye name some reasonable excuse for being at large?\"\\n\\n\"By the two signs,\" answers Tobin, trying to explain, \"which ye display\\naccording to the reading of the Egyptian palmist from the sole of me\\nhand, ye\\'ve been nominated to offset with good luck the lines of trouble\\nleading to the nigger man and the blonde lady with her feet crossed in\\nthe boat, besides the financial loss of a dollar sixty-five, all so far\\nfulfilled according to Hoyle.\"\\n\\nThe man stopped smoking and looked at me.\\n\\n\"Have ye any amendments,\" he asks, \"to offer to that statement, or are\\nye one too? I thought by the looks of ye ye might have him in charge.\"\\n\\n\"None,\" says I to him, \"except that as one horseshoe resembles another\\nso are ye the picture of good luck as predicted by the hand of me\\nfriend. If not, then the lines of Danny\\'s hand may have been crossed,\\nI don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s two of ye,\" says the man with the nose, looking up and down\\nfor the sight of a policeman. \"I\\'ve enjoyed your company immense.\\nGood-night.\"\\n\\nWith that he shoves his segar in his mouth and moves across the street,\\nstepping fast. But Tobin sticks close to one side of him and me at the\\nother.\\n\\n\"What!\" says he, stopping on the opposite sidewalk and pushing back his\\nhat; \"do ye follow me? I tell ye,\" he says, very loud, \"I\\'m proud to\\nhave met ye. But it is my desire to be rid of ye. I am off to me home.\"\\n\\n\"Do,\" says Tobin, leaning against his sleeve. \"Do be off to your home.\\nAnd I will sit at the door of it till ye come out in the morning. For\\nthe dependence is upon ye to obviate the curse of the nigger man and the\\nblonde lady and the financial loss of the one-sixty-five.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a strange hallucination,\" says the man, turning to me as a more\\nreasonable lunatic. \"Hadn\\'t ye better get him home?\"\\n\\n\"Listen, man,\" says I to him. \"Daniel Tobin is as sensible as he ever\\nwas. Maybe he is a bit deranged on account of having drink enough to\\ndisturb but not enough to settle his wits, but he is no more than\\nfollowing out the legitimate path of his superstitions and predicaments,\\nwhich I will explain to you.\" With that I relates the facts about\\nthe palmist lady and how the finger of suspicion points to him as an\\ninstrument of good fortune. \"Now, understand,\" I concludes, \"my position\\nin this riot. I am the friend of me friend Tobin, according to me\\ninterpretations. \\'Tis easy to be a friend to the prosperous, for it\\npays; \\'tis not hard to be a friend to the poor, for ye get puffed up by\\ngratitude and have your picture printed standing in front of a tenement\\nwith a scuttle of coal and an orphan in each hand. But it strains the\\nart of friendship to be true friend to a born fool. And that\\'s what I\\'m\\ndoing,\" says I, \"for, in my opinion, there\\'s no fortune to be read from\\nthe palm of me hand that wasn\\'t printed there with the handle of a pick.\\nAnd, though ye\\'ve got the crookedest nose in New York City, I misdoubt\\nthat all the fortune-tellers doing business could milk good luck from\\nye. But the lines of Danny\\'s hand pointed to ye fair, and I\\'ll assist\\nhim to experiment with ye until he\\'s convinced ye\\'re dry.\"\\n\\nAfter that the man turns, sudden, to laughing. He leans against a corner\\nand laughs considerable. Then he claps me and Tobin on the backs of us\\nand takes us by an arm apiece.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis my mistake,\" says he. \"How could I be expecting anything so fine\\nand wonderful to be turning the corner upon me? I came near being found\\nunworthy. Hard by,\" says he, \"is a cafÃ©, snug and suitable for the\\nentertainment of idiosyncrasies. Let us go there and have drink while we\\ndiscuss the unavailability of the categorical.\"\\n\\nSo saying, he marched me and Tobin to the back room of a saloon, and\\nordered the drinks, and laid the money on the table. He looks at me and\\nTobin like brothers of his, and we have the segars.\\n\\n\"Ye must know,\" says the man of destiny, \"that me walk in life is\\none that is called the literary. I wander abroad be night seeking\\nidiosyncrasies in the masses and truth in the heavens above. When ye\\ncame upon me I was in contemplation of the elevated road in conjunction\\nwith the chief luminary of night. The rapid transit is poetry and art:\\nthe moon but a tedious, dry body, moving by rote. But these are private\\nopinions, for, in the business of literature, the conditions are\\nreversed. \\'Tis me hope to be writing a book to explain the strange\\nthings I have discovered in life.\"\\n\\n\"Ye will put me in a book,\" says Tobin, disgusted; \"will ye put me in a\\nbook?\"\\n\\n\"I will not,\" says the man, \"for the covers will not hold ye. Not yet.\\nThe best I can do is to enjoy ye meself, for the time is not ripe for\\ndestroying the limitations of print. Ye would look fantastic in type.\\nAll alone by meself must I drink this cup of joy. But, I thank ye, boys;\\nI am truly grateful.\"\\n\\n\"The talk of ye,\" says Tobin, blowing through his moustache and pounding\\nthe table with his fist, \"is an eyesore to me patience. There was good\\nluck promised out of the crook of your nose, but ye bear fruit like the\\nbang of a drum. Ye resemble, with your noise of books, the wind blowing\\nthrough a crack. Sure, now, I would be thinking the palm of me hand lied\\nbut for the coming true of the nigger man and the blonde lady and--\"\\n\\n\"Whist!\" says the long man; \"would ye be led astray by physiognomy? Me\\nnose will do what it can within bounds. Let us have these glasses filled\\nagain, for \\'tis good to keep idiosyncrasies well moistened, they being\\nsubject to deterioration in a dry moral atmosphere.\"\\n\\nSo, the man of literature makes good, to my notion, for he pays,\\ncheerful, for everything, the capital of me and Tobin being exhausted by\\nprediction. But Tobin is sore, and drinks quiet, with the red showing in\\nhis eye.\\n\\nBy and by we moved out, for \\'twas eleven o\\'clock, and stands a bit upon\\nthe sidewalk. And then the man says he must be going home, and invites\\nme and Tobin to walk that way. We arrives on a side street two blocks\\naway where there is a stretch of brick houses with high stoops and iron\\nfences. The man stops at one of them and looks up at the top windows\\nwhich he finds dark.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis me humble dwelling,\" says he, \"and I begin to perceive by the\\nsigns that me wife has retired to slumber. Therefore I will venture a\\nbit in the way of hospitality. \\'Tis me wish that ye enter the basement\\nroom, where we dine, and partake of a reasonable refreshment. There will\\nbe some fine cold fowl and cheese and a bottle or two of ale. Ye will be\\nwelcome to enter and eat, for I am indebted to ye for diversions.\"\\n\\nThe appetite and conscience of me and Tobin was congenial to the\\nproposition, though \\'twas sticking hard in Danny\\'s superstitions to\\nthink that a few drinks and a cold lunch should represent the good\\nfortune promised by the palm of his hand.\\n\\n\"Step down the steps,\" says the man with the crooked nose, \"and I will\\nenter by the door above and let ye in. I will ask the new girl we have\\nin the kitchen,\" says he, \"to make ye a pot of coffee to drink before ye\\ngo. \\'Tis fine coffee Katie Mahorner makes for a green girl just landed\\nthree months. Step in,\" says the man, \"and I\\'ll send her down to ye.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GIFT OF THE MAGI\\n\\n\\nOne dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it\\nwas in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the\\ngrocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one\\'s cheeks burned\\nwith the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied.\\nThree times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the\\nnext day would be Christmas.\\n\\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little\\ncouch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection\\nthat life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles\\npredominating.\\n\\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first\\nstage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per\\nweek. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that\\nword on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\\n\\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go,\\nand an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring.\\nAlso appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name \"Mr. James\\nDillingham Young.\" The \"Dillingham\" had been flung to the breeze\\nduring a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid\\n$30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of\\n\"Dillingham\" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously\\nof contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James\\nDillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called\\n\"Jim\" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already\\nintroduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\\n\\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag.\\nShe stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a\\ngrey fence in a grey backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she\\nhad only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving\\nevery penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a\\nweek doesn\\'t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated.\\nThey always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a\\nhappy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something\\nfine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being\\nworthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.\\n\\nThere was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have\\nseen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may,\\nby observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips,\\nobtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender,\\nhad mastered the art.\\n\\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her\\neyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within\\ntwenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its\\nfull length.\\n\\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which\\nthey both took a mighty pride. One was Jim\\'s gold watch that had been\\nhis father\\'s and his grandfather\\'s. The other was Della\\'s hair. Had the\\nQueen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have\\nlet her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her\\nMajesty\\'s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all\\nhis treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his\\nwatch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from\\nenvy.\\n\\nSo now Della\\'s beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like\\na cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself\\nalmost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and\\nquickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or\\ntwo splashed on the worn red carpet.\\n\\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of\\nskirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered\\nout the door and down the stairs to the street.\\n\\nWhere she stopped the sign read: \"Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All\\nKinds.\" One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame,\\nlarge, too white, chilly, hardly looked the \"Sofronie.\"\\n\\n\"Will you buy my hair?\" asked Della.\\n\\n\"I buy hair,\" said Madame. \"Take yer hat off and let\\'s have a sight at\\nthe looks of it.\"\\n\\nDown rippled the brown cascade. \"Twenty dollars,\" said Madame, lifting\\nthe mass with a practised hand.\\n\\n\"Give it to me quick,\" said Della.\\n\\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed\\nmetaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim\\'s present.\\n\\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else.\\nThere was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all\\nof them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in\\ndesign, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by\\nmeretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even\\nworthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be\\nJim\\'s. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to\\nboth. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home\\nwith the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly\\nanxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he\\nsometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap\\nthat he used in place of a chain.\\n\\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence\\nand reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went\\nto work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is\\nalways a tremendous task, dear friends--a mammoth task.\\n\\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls\\nthat made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at\\nher reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\\n\\n\"If Jim doesn\\'t kill me,\" she said to herself, \"before he takes a second\\nlook at me, he\\'ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what\\ncould I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?\"\\n\\nAt 7 o\\'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of\\nthe stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\\n\\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on\\nthe corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she\\nheard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she\\nturned white for just a moment. She had a habit for saying little silent\\nprayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered:\\n\"Please God, make him think I am still pretty.\"\\n\\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and\\nvery serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and to be burdened\\nwith a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\\n\\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of\\nquail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in\\nthem that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger,\\nnor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments\\nthat she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with\\nthat peculiar expression on his face.\\n\\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\\n\\n\"Jim, darling,\" she cried, \"don\\'t look at me that way. I had my hair cut\\noff and sold because I couldn\\'t have lived through Christmas without\\ngiving you a present. It\\'ll grow out again--you won\\'t mind, will you?\\nI just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say \\'Merry Christmas!\\'\\nJim, and let\\'s be happy. You don\\'t know what a nice--what a beautiful,\\nnice gift I\\'ve got for you.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve cut off your hair?\" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not\\narrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.\\n\\n\"Cut it off and sold it,\" said Della. \"Don\\'t you like me just as well,\\nanyhow? I\\'m me without my hair, ain\\'t I?\"\\n\\nJim looked about the room curiously.\\n\\n\"You say your hair is gone?\" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t look for it,\" said Della. \"It\\'s sold, I tell you--sold and\\ngone, too. It\\'s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you.\\nMaybe the hairs of my head were numbered,\" she went on with sudden\\nserious sweetness, \"but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall\\nI put the chops on, Jim?\"\\n\\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For\\nten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential\\nobject in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a\\nyear--what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you\\nthe wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not\\namong them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\\n\\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t make any mistake, Dell,\" he said, \"about me. I don\\'t think\\nthere\\'s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that\\ncould make me like my girl any less. But if you\\'ll unwrap that package\\nyou may see why you had me going a while at first.\"\\n\\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an\\necstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to\\nhysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of\\nall the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\\n\\nFor there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had\\nworshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise\\nshell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful\\nvanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart\\nhad simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of\\npossession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have\\nadorned the coveted adornments were gone.\\n\\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up\\nwith dim eyes and a smile and say: \"My hair grows so fast, Jim!\"\\n\\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, \"Oh, oh!\"\\n\\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him\\neagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with\\na reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You\\'ll have\\nto look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I\\nwant to see how it looks on it.\"\\n\\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands\\nunder the back of his head and smiled.\\n\\n\"Dell,\" said he, \"let\\'s put our Christmas presents away and keep \\'em a\\nwhile. They\\'re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get\\nthe money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.\"\\n\\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men--who brought\\ngifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving\\nChristmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones,\\npossibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication.\\nAnd here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two\\nfoolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other\\nthe greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of\\nthese days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the\\nwisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest.\\nEverywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA COSMOPOLITE IN A CAFÃ‰\\n\\n\\nAt midnight the cafÃ© was crowded. By some chance the little table at\\nwhich I sat had escaped the eye of incomers, and two vacant chairs at it\\nextended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons.\\n\\nAnd then a cosmopolite sat in one of them, and I was glad, for I held\\na theory that since Adam no true citizen of the world has existed. We\\nhear of them, and we see foreign labels on much luggage, but we find\\ntravellers instead of cosmopolites.\\n\\nI invoke your consideration of the scene--the marble-topped tables, the\\nrange of leather-upholstered wall seats, the gay company, the ladies\\ndressed in demi-state toilets, speaking in an exquisite visible chorus\\nof taste, economy, opulence or art; the sedulous and largess-loving\\n_garÃ§ons_, the music wisely catering to all with its raids upon the\\ncomposers; the _mÃ©lange_ of talk and laughter--and, if you will, the\\nWÃ¼rzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe\\ncherry sways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay. I was told by\\na sculptor from Mauch Chunk that the scene was truly Parisian.\\n\\nMy cosmopolite was named E. Rushmore Coglan, and he will be heard from\\nnext summer at Coney Island. He is to establish a new \"attraction\"\\nthere, he informed me, offering kingly diversion. And then his\\nconversation rang along parallels of latitude and longitude. He took the\\ngreat, round world in his hand, so to speak, familiarly, contemptuously,\\nand it seemed no larger than the seed of a Maraschino cherry in a\\n_table d\\'hÃ´te_ grape fruit. He spoke disrespectfully of the equator, he\\nskipped from continent to continent, he derided the zones, he mopped\\nup the high seas with his napkin. With a wave of his hand he would\\nspeak of a certain bazaar in Hyderabad. Whiff! He would have you on\\nskis in Lapland. Zip! Now you rode the breakers with the Kanakas at\\nKealaikahiki. Presto! He dragged you through an Arkansas post-oak swamp,\\nlet you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his Idaho ranch, then\\nwhirled you into the society of Viennese archdukes. Anon he would be\\ntelling you of a cold he acquired in a Chicago lake breeze and how old\\nEscamila cured it in Buenos Ayres with a hot infusion of the _chuchula_\\nweed. You would have addressed a letter to \"E. Rushmore Coglan, Esq.,\\nthe Earth, Solar System, the Universe,\" and have mailed it, feeling\\nconfident that it would be delivered to him.\\n\\nI was sure that I had found at last the one true cosmopolite since Adam,\\nand I listened to his worldwide discourse fearful lest I should discover\\nin it the local note of the mere globe-trotter. But his opinions never\\nfluttered or drooped; he was as impartial to cities, countries and\\ncontinents as the winds or gravitation.\\n\\nAnd as E. Rushmore Coglan prattled of this little planet I thought with\\nglee of a great almost-cosmopolite who wrote for the whole world and\\ndedicated himself to Bombay. In a poem he has to say that there is pride\\nand rivalry between the cities of the earth, and that \"the men that\\nbreed from them, they traffic up and down, but cling to their cities\\'\\nhem as a child to the mother\\'s gown.\" And whenever they walk \"by roaring\\nstreets unknown\" they remember their native city \"most faithful,\\nfoolish, fond; making her mere-breathed name their bond upon their\\nbond.\" And my glee was roused because I had caught Mr. Kipling napping.\\nHere I had found a man not made from dust; one who had no narrow boasts\\nof birthplace or country, one who, if he bragged at all, would brag of\\nhis whole round globe against the Martians and the inhabitants of the\\nMoon.\\n\\nExpression on these subjects was precipitated from E. Rushmore Coglan\\nby the third corner to our table. While Coglan was describing to me\\nthe topography along the Siberian Railway the orchestra glided into a\\nmedley. The concluding air was \"Dixie,\" and as the exhilarating notes\\ntumbled forth they were almost overpowered by a great clapping of hands\\nfrom almost every table.\\n\\nIt is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be\\nwitnessed every evening in numerous cafÃ©s in the City of New York. Tons\\nof brew have been consumed over theories to account for it. Some have\\nconjectured hastily that all Southerners in town hie themselves to cafÃ©s\\nat nightfall. This applause of the \"rebel\" air in a Northern city does\\npuzzle a little; but it is not insolvable. The war with Spain, many\\nyears\\' generous mint and watermelon crops, a few long-shot winners at\\nthe New Orleans race-track, and the brilliant banquets given by the\\nIndiana and Kansas citizens who compose the North Carolina Society have\\nmade the South rather a \"fad\" in Manhattan. Your manicure will lisp\\nsoftly that your left forefinger reminds her so much of a gentleman\\'s in\\nRichmond, Va. Oh, certainly; but many a lady has to work now--the war,\\nyou know.\\n\\nWhen \"Dixie\" was being played a dark-haired young man sprang up from\\nsomewhere with a Mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his\\nsoft-brimmed hat. Then he strayed through the smoke, dropped into the\\nvacant chair at our table and pulled out cigarettes.\\n\\nThe evening was at the period when reserve is thawed. One of us\\nmentioned three WÃ¼rzburgers to the waiter; the dark-haired young man\\nacknowledged his inclusion in the order by a smile and a nod. I hastened\\nto ask him a question because I wanted to try out a theory I had.\\n\\n\"Would you mind telling me,\" I began, \"whether you are from--\"\\n\\nThe fist of E. Rushmore Coglan banged the table and I was jarred into\\nsilence.\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" said he, \"but that\\'s a question I never like to hear asked.\\nWhat does it matter where a man is from? Is it fair to judge a man by\\nhis post-office address? Why, I\\'ve seen Kentuckians who hated whiskey,\\nVirginians who weren\\'t descended from Pocahontas, Indianians who hadn\\'t\\nwritten a novel, Mexicans who didn\\'t wear velvet trousers with silver\\ndollars sewed along the seams, funny Englishmen, spendthrift Yankees,\\ncold-blooded Southerners, narrow-minded Westerners, and New Yorkers who\\nwere too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a one-armed\\ngrocer\\'s clerk do up cranberries in paper bags. Let a man be a man and\\ndon\\'t handicap him with the label of any section.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me,\" I said, \"but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one.\\nI know the South, and when the band plays \\'Dixie\\' I like to observe. I\\nhave formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special\\nviolence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of\\neither Secaucus, N.J., or the district between Murray Hill Lyceum and\\nthe Harlem River, this city. I was about to put my opinion to the\\ntest by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your\\nown--larger theory, I must confess.\"\\n\\nAnd now the dark-haired young man spoke to me, and it became evident\\nthat his mind also moved along its own set of grooves.\\n\\n\"I should like to be a periwinkle,\" said he, mysteriously, \"on the top\\nof a valley, and sing tooralloo-ralloo.\"\\n\\nThis was clearly too obscure, so I turned again to Coglan.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been around the world twelve times,\" said he. \"I know an Esquimau\\nin Upernavik who sends to Cincinnati for his neckties, and I saw a\\ngoat-herder in Uruguay who won a prize in a Battle Creek breakfast food\\npuzzle competition. I pay rent on a room in Cairo, Egypt, and another\\nin Yokohama all the year around. I\\'ve got slippers waiting for me in a\\ntea-house in Shanghai, and I don\\'t have to tell \\'em how to cook my eggs\\nin Rio de Janeiro or Seattle. It\\'s a mighty little old world. What\\'s the\\nuse of bragging about being from the North, or the South, or the old\\nmanor house in the dale, or Euclid avenue, Cleveland, or Pike\\'s Peak, or\\nFairfax County, Va., or Hooligan\\'s Flats or any place? It\\'ll be a better\\nworld when we quit being fools about some mildewed town or ten acres of\\nswampland just because we happened to be born there.\"\\n\\n\"You seem to be a genuine cosmopolite,\" I said admiringly. \"But it also\\nseems that you would decry patriotism.\"\\n\\n\"A relic of the stone age,\" declared Coglan, warmly. \"We are all\\nbrothers--Chinamen, Englishmen, Zulus, Patagonians and the people in the\\nbend of the Kaw River. Some day all this petty pride in one\\'s city or\\nState or section or country will be wiped out, and we\\'ll all be citizens\\nof the world, as we ought to be.\"\\n\\n\"But while you are wandering in foreign lands,\" I persisted, \"do not\\nyour thoughts revert to some spot--some dear and--\"\\n\\n\"Nary a spot,\" interrupted E. R. Coglan, flippantly. \"The terrestrial,\\nglobular, planetary hunk of matter, slightly flattened at the poles, and\\nknown as the Earth, is my abode. I\\'ve met a good many object-bound\\ncitizens of this country abroad. I\\'ve seen men from Chicago sit in a\\ngondola in Venice on a moonlight night and brag about their drainage\\ncanal. I\\'ve seen a Southerner on being introduced to the King of England\\nhand that monarch, without batting his eyes, the information that\\nhis grand-aunt on his mother\\'s side was related by marriage to the\\nPerkinses, of Charleston. I knew a New Yorker who was kidnapped for\\nransom by some Afghanistan bandits. His people sent over the money and\\nhe came back to Kabul with the agent. \\'Afghanistan?\\' the natives said to\\nhim through an interpreter. \\'Well, not so slow, do you think?\\' \\'Oh, I\\ndon\\'t know,\\' says he, and he begins to tell them about a cab driver at\\nSixth avenue and Broadway. Those ideas don\\'t suit me. I\\'m not tied down\\nto anything that isn\\'t 8,000 miles in diameter. Just put me down as E.\\nRushmore Coglan, citizen of the terrestrial sphere.\"\\n\\nMy cosmopolite made a large adieu and left me, for he thought he saw\\nsome one through the chatter and smoke whom he knew. So I was left with\\nthe would-be periwinkle, who was reduced to WÃ¼rzburger without further\\nability to voice his aspirations to perch, melodious, upon the summit of\\na valley.\\n\\nI sat reflecting upon my evident cosmopolite and wondering how the poet\\nhad managed to miss him. He was my discovery and I believed in him. How\\nwas it? \"The men that breed from them they traffic up and down, but\\ncling to their cities\\' hem as a child to the mother\\'s gown.\"\\n\\nNot so E. Rushmore Coglan. With the whole world for his--\\n\\nMy meditations were interrupted by a tremendous noise and conflict in\\nanother part of the cafÃ©. I saw above the heads of the seated patrons E.\\nRushmore Coglan and a stranger to me engaged in terrific battle. They\\nfought between the tables like Titans, and glasses crashed, and men\\ncaught their hats up and were knocked down, and a brunette screamed, and\\na blonde began to sing \"Teasing.\"\\n\\nMy cosmopolite was sustaining the pride and reputation of the Earth when\\nthe waiters closed in on both combatants with their famous flying wedge\\nformation and bore them outside, still resisting.\\n\\nI called McCarthy, one of the French _garÃ§ons_, and asked him the cause\\nof the conflict.\\n\\n\"The man with the red tie\" (that was my cosmopolite), said he, \"got hot\\non account of things said about the bum sidewalks and water supply of\\nthe place he come from by the other guy.\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" said I, bewildered, \"that man is a citizen of the world--a\\ncosmopolite. He--\"\\n\\n\"Originally from Mattawamkeag, Maine, he said,\" continued McCarthy,\\n\"and he wouldn\\'t stand for no knockin\\' the place.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBETWEEN ROUNDS\\n\\n\\nThe May moon shone bright upon the private boarding-house of Mrs.\\nMurphy. By reference to the almanac a large amount of territory will\\nbe discovered upon which its rays also fell. Spring was in its heydey,\\nwith hay fever soon to follow. The parks were green with new leaves and\\nbuyers for the Western and Southern trade. Flowers and summer-resort\\nagents were blowing; the air and answers to Lawson were growing milder;\\nhand-organs, fountains and pinochle were playing everywhere.\\n\\nThe windows of Mrs. Murphy\\'s boarding-house were open. A group of\\nboarders were seated on the high stoop upon round, flat mats like\\nGerman pancakes.\\n\\nIn one of the second-floor front windows Mrs. McCaskey awaited her\\nhusband. Supper was cooling on the table. Its heat went into Mrs.\\nMcCaskey.\\n\\nAt nine Mr. McCaskey came. He carried his coat on his arm and his pipe\\nin his teeth; and he apologised for disturbing the boarders on the steps\\nas he selected spots of stone between them on which to set his size 9,\\nwidth Ds.\\n\\nAs he opened the door of his room he received a surprise. Instead of the\\nusual stove-lid or potato-masher for him to dodge, came only words.\\n\\nMr. McCaskey reckoned that the benign May moon had softened the breast\\nof his spouse.\\n\\n\"I heard ye,\" came the oral substitutes for kitchenware. \"Ye can\\napollygise to riff-raff of the streets for settin\\' yer unhandy feet on\\nthe tails of their frocks, but ye\\'d walk on the neck of yer wife the\\nlength of a clothes-line without so much as a \\'Kiss me fut,\\' and I\\'m\\nsure it\\'s that long from rubberin\\' out the windy for ye and the victuals\\ncold such as there\\'s money to buy after drinkin\\' up yer wages at\\nGallegher\\'s every Saturday evenin\\', and the gas man here twice to-day\\nfor his.\"\\n\\n\"Woman!\" said Mr. McCaskey, dashing his coat and hat upon a chair, \"the\\nnoise of ye is an insult to me appetite. When ye run down politeness ye\\ntake the mortar from between the bricks of the foundations of society.\\n\\'Tis no more than exercisin\\' the acrimony of a gentleman when ye ask the\\ndissent of ladies blockin\\' the way for steppin\\' between them. Will ye\\nbring the pig\\'s face of ye out of the windy and see to the food?\"\\n\\nMrs. McCaskey arose heavily and went to the stove. There was something\\nin her manner that warned Mr. McCaskey. When the corners of her mouth\\nwent down suddenly like a barometer it usually foretold a fall of\\ncrockery and tinware.\\n\\n\"Pig\\'s face, is it?\" said Mrs. McCaskey, and hurled a stewpan full of\\nbacon and turnips at her lord.\\n\\nMr. McCaskey was no novice at repartee. He knew what should follow\\nthe entrÃ©e. On the table was a roast sirloin of pork, garnished with\\nshamrocks. He retorted with this, and drew the appropriate return of\\na bread pudding in an earthen dish. A hunk of Swiss cheese accurately\\nthrown by her husband struck Mrs. McCaskey below one eye. When she\\nreplied with a well-aimed coffee-pot full of a hot, black, semi-fragrant\\nliquid the battle, according to courses, should have ended.\\n\\nBut Mr. McCaskey was no 50-cent _table d\\'hÃ´ter_. Let cheap Bohemians\\nconsider coffee the end, if they would. Let them make that _faux pas_.\\nHe was foxier still. Finger-bowls were not beyond the compass of his\\nexperience. They were not to be had in the Pension Murphy; but their\\nequivalent was at hand. Triumphantly he sent the granite-ware wash\\nbasin at the head of his matrimonial adversary. Mrs. McCaskey dodged in\\ntime. She reached for a flatiron, with which, as a sort of cordial, she\\nhoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close. But a loud, wailing\\nscream downstairs caused both her and Mr. McCaskey to pause in a sort of\\ninvoluntary armistice.\\n\\nOn the sidewalk at the corner of the house Policeman Cleary was standing\\nwith one ear upturned, listening to the crash of household utensils.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis Jawn McCaskey and his missis at it again,\" meditated the\\npoliceman. \"I wonder shall I go up and stop the row. I will not. Married\\nfolks they are; and few pleasures they have. \\'Twill not last long. Sure,\\nthey\\'ll have to borrow more dishes to keep it up with.\"\\n\\nAnd just then came the loud scream below-stairs, betokening fear or dire\\nextremity. \"\\'Tis probably the cat,\" said Policeman Cleary, and walked\\nhastily in the other direction.\\n\\nThe boarders on the steps were fluttered. Mr. Toomey, an insurance\\nsolicitor by birth and an investigator by profession, went inside\\nto analyse the scream. He returned with the news that Mrs. Murphy\\'s\\nlittle boy, Mike, was lost. Following the messenger, out bounced Mrs.\\nMurphy--two hundred pounds in tears and hysterics, clutching the air\\nand howling to the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and\\nmischief. Bathos, truly; but Mr. Toomey sat down at the side of Miss\\nPurdy, millinery, and their hands came together in sympathy. The two old\\nmaids, Misses Walsh, who complained every day about the noise in the\\nhalls, inquired immediately if anybody had looked behind the clock.\\n\\nMajor Grigg, who sat by his fat wife on the top step, arose and buttoned\\nhis coat. \"The little one lost?\" he exclaimed. \"I will scour the city.\"\\nHis wife never allowed him out after dark. But now she said: \"Go,\\nLudovic!\" in a baritone voice. \"Whoever can look upon that mother\\'s\\ngrief without springing to her relief has a heart of stone.\" \"Give me\\nsome thirty or--sixty cents, my love,\" said the Major. \"Lost children\\nsometimes stray far. I may need carfares.\"\\n\\nOld man Denny, hall room, fourth floor back, who sat on the lowest step,\\ntrying to read a paper by the street lamp, turned over a page to follow\\nup the article about the carpenters\\' strike. Mrs. Murphy shrieked to the\\nmoon: \"Oh, ar-r-Mike, f\\'r Gawd\\'s sake, where is me little bit av a boy?\"\\n\\n\"When\\'d ye see him last?\" asked old man Denny, with one eye on the\\nreport of the Building Trades League.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" wailed Mrs. Murphy, \"\\'twas yisterday, or maybe four hours ago!\\nI dunno. But it\\'s lost he is, me little boy Mike. He was playin\\' on\\nthe sidewalk only this mornin\\'--or was it Wednesday? I\\'m that busy with\\nwork, \\'tis hard to keep up with dates. But I\\'ve looked the house over\\nfrom top to cellar, and it\\'s gone he is. Oh, for the love av Hiven--\"\\n\\nSilent, grim, colossal, the big city has ever stood against its\\nrevilers. They call it hard as iron; they say that no pulse of pity\\nbeats in its bosom; they compare its streets with lonely forests and\\ndeserts of lava. But beneath the hard crust of the lobster is found a\\ndelectable and luscious food. Perhaps a different simile would have been\\nwiser. Still, nobody should take offence. We would call no one a lobster\\nwithout good and sufficient claws.\\n\\nNo calamity so touches the common heart of humanity as does the straying\\nof a little child. Their feet are so uncertain and feeble; the ways are\\nso steep and strange.\\n\\nMajor Griggs hurried down to the corner, and up the avenue into Billy\\'s\\nplace. \"Gimme a rye-high,\" he said to the servitor. \"Haven\\'t seen a\\nbow-legged, dirty-faced little devil of a six-year-old lost kid around\\nhere anywhere, have you?\"\\n\\nMr. Toomey retained Miss Purdy\\'s hand on the steps. \"Think of that dear\\nlittle babe,\" said Miss Purdy, \"lost from his mother\\'s side--perhaps\\nalready fallen beneath the iron hoofs of galloping steeds--oh, isn\\'t it\\ndreadful?\"\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t that right?\" agreed Mr. Toomey, squeezing her hand. \"Say I start\\nout and help look for um!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Miss Purdy, \"you should. But, oh, Mr. Toomey, you are so\\ndashing--so reckless--suppose in your enthusiasm some accident should\\nbefall you, then what--\"\\n\\nOld man Denny read on about the arbitration agreement, with one finger\\non the lines.\\n\\nIn the second floor front Mr. and Mrs. McCaskey came to the window to\\nrecover their second wind. Mr. McCaskey was scooping turnips out of his\\nvest with a crooked forefinger, and his lady was wiping an eye that the\\nsalt of the roast pork had not benefited. They heard the outcry below,\\nand thrust their heads out of the window.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis little Mike is lost,\" said Mrs. McCaskey, in a hushed voice, \"the\\nbeautiful, little, trouble-making angel of a gossoon!\"\\n\\n\"The bit of a boy mislaid?\" said Mr. McCaskey, leaning out of the\\nwindow. \"Why, now, that\\'s bad enough, entirely. The childer, they be\\ndifferent. If \\'twas a woman I\\'d be willin\\', for they leave peace behind\\n\\'em when they go.\"\\n\\nDisregarding the thrust, Mrs. McCaskey caught her husband\\'s arm.\\n\\n\"Jawn,\" she said, sentimentally, \"Missis Murphy\\'s little bye is lost.\\n\\'Tis a great city for losing little boys. Six years old he was. Jawn,\\n\\'tis the same age our little bye would have been if we had had one six\\nyears ago.\"\\n\\n\"We never did,\" said Mr. McCaskey, lingering with the fact.\\n\\n\"But if we had, Jawn, think what sorrow would be in our hearts this\\nnight, with our little Phelan run away and stolen in the city nowheres\\nat all.\"\\n\\n\"Ye talk foolishness,\" said Mr. McCaskey. \"\\'Tis Pat he would be named,\\nafter me old father in Cantrim.\"\\n\\n\"Ye lie!\" said Mrs. McCaskey, without anger. \"Me brother was worth tin\\ndozen bog-trotting McCaskeys. After him would the bye be named.\" She\\nleaned over the window-sill and looked down at the hurrying and bustle\\nbelow.\\n\\n\"Jawn,\" said Mrs. McCaskey, softly, \"I\\'m sorry I was hasty wid ye.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas hasty puddin\\', as ye say,\" said her husband, \"and hurry-up\\nturnips and get-a-move-on-ye coffee. \\'Twas what ye could call a quick\\nlunch, all right, and tell no lie.\"\\n\\nMrs. McCaskey slipped her arm inside her husband\\'s and took his rough\\nhand in hers.\\n\\n\"Listen at the cryin\\' of poor Mrs. Murphy,\" she said. \"\\'Tis an awful\\nthing for a bit of a bye to be lost in this great big city. If \\'twas our\\nlittle Phelan, Jawn, I\\'d be breakin\\' me heart.\"\\n\\nAwkwardly Mr. McCaskey withdrew his hand. But he laid it around the\\nnearing shoulder of his wife.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis foolishness, of course,\" said he, roughly, \"but I\\'d be cut up\\nsome meself if our little Pat was kidnapped or anything. But there\\nnever was any childer for us. Sometimes I\\'ve been ugly and hard with\\nye, Judy. Forget it.\"\\n\\nThey leaned together, and looked down at the heart-drama being acted\\nbelow.\\n\\nLong they sat thus. People surged along the sidewalk, crowding,\\nquestioning, filling the air with rumours, and inconsequent surmises.\\nMrs. Murphy ploughed back and forth in their midst, like a soft\\nmountain down which plunged an audible cataract of tears. Couriers\\ncame and went.\\n\\nLoud voices and a renewed uproar were raised in front of the\\nboarding-house.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up now, Judy?\" asked Mr. McCaskey.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis Missis Murphy\\'s voice,\" said Mrs. McCaskey, harking. \"She says\\nshe\\'s after finding little Mike asleep behind the roll of old linoleum\\nunder the bed in her room.\"\\n\\nMr. McCaskey laughed loudly.\\n\\n\"That\\'s yer Phelan,\" he shouted, sardonically. \"Divil a bit would a Pat\\nhave done that trick. If the bye we never had is strayed and stole, by\\nthe powers, call him Phelan, and see him hide out under the bed like a\\nmangy pup.\"\\n\\nMrs. McCaskey arose heavily, and went toward the dish closet, with the\\ncorners of her mouth drawn down.\\n\\nPoliceman Cleary came back around the corner as the crowd dispersed.\\nSurprised, he upturned an ear toward the McCaskey apartment, where the\\ncrash of irons and chinaware and the ring of hurled kitchen utensils\\nseemed as loud as before. Policeman Cleary took out his timepiece.\\n\\n\"By the deported snakes!\" he exclaimed, \"Jawn McCaskey and his lady have\\nbeen fightin\\' for an hour and a quarter by the watch. The missis could\\ngive him forty pounds weight. Strength to his arm.\"\\n\\nPoliceman Cleary strolled back around the corner.\\n\\nOld man Denny folded his paper and hurried up the steps just as Mrs.\\nMurphy was about to lock the door for the night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SKYLIGHT ROOM\\n\\n\\nFirst Mrs. Parker would show you the double parlours. You would not dare\\nto interrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of\\nthe gentleman who had occupied them for eight years. Then you would\\nmanage to stammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor\\nnor a dentist. Mrs. Parker\\'s manner of receiving the admission was such\\nthat you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your\\nparents, who had neglected to train you up in one of the professions\\nthat fitted Mrs. Parker\\'s parlours.\\n\\nNext you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the\\nsecond-floor-back at $8. Convinced by her second-floor manner that it\\nwas worth the $12 that Mr. Toosenberry always paid for it until he left\\nto take charge of his brother\\'s orange plantation in Florida near Palm\\nBeach, where Mrs. McIntyre always spent the winters that had the double\\nfront room with private bath, you managed to babble that you wanted\\nsomething still cheaper.\\n\\nIf you survived Mrs. Parker\\'s scorn, you were taken to look at Mr.\\nSkidder\\'s large hall room on the third floor. Mr. Skidder\\'s room was not\\nvacant. He wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long. But\\nevery room-hunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins.\\nAfter each visit, Mr. Skidder, from the fright caused by possible\\neviction, would pay something on his rent.\\n\\nThen--oh, then--if you still stood on one foot, with your hot hand\\nclutching the three moist dollars in your pocket, and hoarsely\\nproclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty, nevermore would Mrs.\\nParker be cicerone of yours. She would honk loudly the word \"Clara,\" she\\nwould show you her back, and march downstairs. Then Clara, the coloured\\nmaid, would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth\\nflight, and show you the Skylight Room. It occupied 7x8 feet of floor\\nspace at the middle of the hall. On each side of it was a dark lumber\\ncloset or storeroom.\\n\\nIn it was an iron cot, a washstand and a chair. A shelf was the dresser.\\nIts four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a\\ncoffin. Your hand crept to your throat, you gasped, you looked up as\\nfrom a well--and breathed once more. Through the glass of the little\\nskylight you saw a square of blue infinity.\\n\\n\"Two dollars, suh,\" Clara would say in her half-contemptuous,\\nhalf-Tuskegeenial tones.\\n\\nOne day Miss Leeson came hunting for a room. She carried a typewriter\\nmade to be lugged around by a much larger lady. She was a very little\\ngirl, with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped\\nand that always looked as if they were saying: \"Goodness me! Why didn\\'t\\nyou keep up with us?\"\\n\\nMrs. Parker showed her the double parlours. \"In this closet,\" she said,\\n\"one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal--\"\\n\\n\"But I am neither a doctor nor a dentist,\" said Miss Leeson, with a\\nshiver.\\n\\nMrs. Parker gave her the incredulous, pitying, sneering, icy stare that\\nshe kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists, and led\\nthe way to the second floor back.\\n\\n\"Eight dollars?\" said Miss Leeson. \"Dear me! I\\'m not Hetty if I do look\\ngreen. I\\'m just a poor little working girl. Show me something higher and\\nlower.\"\\n\\nMr. Skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap\\non his door.\\n\\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Skidder,\" said Mrs. Parker, with her demon\\'s smile at\\nhis pale looks. \"I didn\\'t know you were in. I asked the lady to have a\\nlook at your lambrequins.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re too lovely for anything,\" said Miss Leeson, smiling in exactly\\nthe way the angels do.\\n\\nAfter they had gone Mr. Skidder got very busy erasing the tall,\\nblack-haired heroine from his latest (unproduced) play and inserting a\\nsmall, roguish one with heavy, bright hair and vivacious features.\\n\\n\"Anna Held\\'ll jump at it,\" said Mr. Skidder to himself, putting his feet\\nup against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an\\naerial cuttlefish.\\n\\nPresently the tocsin call of \"Clara!\" sounded to the world the state\\nof Miss Leeson\\'s purse. A dark goblin seized her, mounted a Stygian\\nstairway, thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top\\nand muttered the menacing and cabalistic words \"Two dollars!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take it!\" sighed Miss Leeson, sinking down upon the squeaky iron\\nbed.\\n\\nEvery day Miss Leeson went out to work. At night she brought home papers\\nwith handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter. Sometimes\\nshe had no work at night, and then she would sit on the steps of the\\nhigh stoop with the other roomers. Miss Leeson was not intended for\\na sky-light room when the plans were drawn for her creation. She was\\ngay-hearted and full of tender, whimsical fancies. Once she let Mr.\\nSkidder read to her three acts of his great (unpublished) comedy, \"It\\'s\\nNo Kid; or, The Heir of the Subway.\"\\n\\nThere was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever Miss Leeson had\\ntime to sit on the steps for an hour or two. But Miss Longnecker, the\\ntall blonde who taught in a public school and said, \"Well, really!\" to\\neverything you said, sat on the top step and sniffed. And Miss Dorn,\\nwho shot at the moving ducks at Coney every Sunday and worked in a\\ndepartment store, sat on the bottom step and sniffed. Miss Leeson sat\\non the middle step and the men would quickly group around her.\\n\\nEspecially Mr. Skidder, who had cast her in his mind for the star part\\nin a private, romantic (unspoken) drama in real life. And especially Mr.\\nHoover, who was forty-five, fat, flush and foolish. And especially very\\nyoung Mr. Evans, who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him\\nto leave off cigarettes. The men voted her \"the funniest and jolliest\\never,\" but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were\\nimplacable.\\n\\n\\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\nI pray you let the drama halt while Chorus stalks to the footlights and\\ndrops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of Mr. Hoover. Tune the pipes\\nto the tragedy of tallow, the bane of bulk, the calamity of corpulence.\\nTried out, Falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than\\nwould have Romeo\\'s rickety ribs to the ounce. A lover may sigh, but he\\nmust not puff. To the train of Momus are the fat men remanded. In vain\\nbeats the faithfullest heart above a 52-inch belt. Avaunt, Hoover!\\nHoover, forty-five, flush and foolish, might carry off Helen herself;\\nHoover, forty-five, flush, foolish and fat is meat for perdition. There\\nwas never a chance for you, Hoover.\\n\\nAs Mrs. Parker\\'s roomers sat thus one summer\\'s evening, Miss Leeson\\nlooked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh:\\n\\n\"Why, there\\'s Billy Jackson! I can see him from down here, too.\"\\n\\nAll looked up--some at the windows of skyscrapers, some casting about\\nfor an airship, Jackson-guided.\\n\\n\"It\\'s that star,\" explained Miss Leeson, pointing with a tiny finger.\\n\"Not the big one that twinkles--the steady blue one near it. I can see\\nit every night through my skylight. I named it Billy Jackson.\"\\n\\n\"Well, really!\" said Miss Longnecker. \"I didn\\'t know you were an\\nastronomer, Miss Leeson.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the small star gazer, \"I know as much as any of them\\nabout the style of sleeves they\\'re going to wear next fall in Mars.\"\\n\\n\"Well, really!\" said Miss Longnecker. \"The star you refer to is Gamma,\\nof the constellation Cassiopeia. It is nearly of the second magnitude,\\nand its meridian passage is--\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said the very young Mr. Evans, \"I think Billy Jackson is a much\\nbetter name for it.\"\\n\\n\"Same here,\" said Mr. Hoover, loudly breathing defiance to Miss\\nLongnecker. \"I think Miss Leeson has just as much right to name stars\\nas any of those old astrologers had.\"\\n\\n\"Well, really!\" said Miss Longnecker.\\n\\n\"I wonder whether it\\'s a shooting star,\" remarked Miss Dorn. \"I hit\\nnine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at Coney Sunday.\"\\n\\n\"He doesn\\'t show up very well from down here,\" said Miss Leeson. \"You\\nought to see him from my room. You know you can see stars even in the\\ndaytime from the bottom of a well. At night my room is like the shaft of\\na coal mine, and it makes Billy Jackson look like the big diamond pin\\nthat Night fastens her kimono with.\"\\n\\nThere came a time after that when Miss Leeson brought no formidable\\npapers home to copy. And when she went out in the morning, instead of\\nworking, she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in\\nthe drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys. This\\nwent on.\\n\\nThere came an evening when she wearily climbed Mrs. Parker\\'s stoop at\\nthe hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant. But\\nshe had had no dinner.\\n\\nAs she stepped into the hall Mr. Hoover met her and seized his chance.\\nHe asked her to marry him, and his fatness hovered above her like an\\navalanche. She dodged, and caught the balustrade. He tried for her hand,\\nand she raised it and smote him weakly in the face. Step by step she\\nwent up, dragging herself by the railing. She passed Mr. Skidder\\'s door\\nas he was red-inking a stage direction for Myrtle Delorme (Miss Leeson)\\nin his (unaccepted) comedy, to \"pirouette across stage from L to the\\nside of the Count.\" Up the carpeted ladder she crawled at last and\\nopened the door of the skylight room.\\n\\nShe was too weak to light the lamp or to undress. She fell upon the iron\\ncot, her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs. And in that\\nErebus of the skylight room, she slowly raised her heavy eyelids, and\\nsmiled.\\n\\nFor Billy Jackson was shining down on her, calm and bright and constant\\nthrough the skylight. There was no world about her. She was sunk in a\\npit of blackness, with but that small square of pallid light framing the\\nstar that she had so whimsically and oh, so ineffectually named. Miss\\nLongnecker must be right; it was Gamma, of the constellation Cassiopeia,\\nand not Billy Jackson. And yet she could not let it be Gamma.\\n\\nAs she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm. The third time\\nshe got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black\\npit to Billy Jackson. Her arm fell back limply.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, Billy,\" she murmured faintly. \"You\\'re millions of miles away\\nand you won\\'t even twinkle once. But you kept where I could see you most\\nof the time up there when there wasn\\'t anything else but darkness to\\nlook at, didn\\'t you? . . . Millions of miles. . . . Good-bye, Billy\\nJackson.\"\\n\\nClara, the coloured maid, found the door locked at 10 the next day,\\nand they forced it open. Vinegar, and the slapping of wrists and burnt\\nfeathers proving of no avail, some one ran to \\'phone for an ambulance.\\n\\nIn due time it backed up to the door with much gong-clanging, and the\\ncapable young medico, in his white linen coat, ready, active, confident,\\nwith his smooth face half debonair, half grim, danced up the steps.\\n\\n\"Ambulance call to 49,\" he said briefly. \"What\\'s the trouble?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, doctor,\" sniffed Mrs. Parker, as though her trouble that there\\nshould be trouble in the house was the greater. \"I can\\'t think what can\\nbe the matter with her. Nothing we could do would bring her to. It\\'s a\\nyoung woman, a Miss Elsie--yes, a Miss Elsie Leeson. Never\\nbefore in my house--\"\\n\\n\"What room?\" cried the doctor in a terrible voice, to which Mrs. Parker\\nwas a stranger.\\n\\n\"The skylight room. It--\"\\n\\nEvidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of\\nskylight rooms. He was gone up the stairs, four at a time. Mrs. Parker\\nfollowed slowly, as her dignity demanded.\\n\\nOn the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in\\nhis arms. He stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue,\\nnot loudly. Gradually Mrs. Parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips\\ndown from a nail. Ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and\\nbody. Sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said\\nto her.\\n\\n\"Let that be,\" she would answer. \"If I can get forgiveness for having\\nheard it I will be satisfied.\"\\n\\nThe ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of\\nhounds that follow the curiosity chase, and even they fell back along\\nthe sidewalk abashed, for his face was that of one who bears his own\\ndead.\\n\\nThey noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in\\nthe ambulance the form that he carried, and all that he said was: \"Drive\\nlike h----l, Wilson,\" to the driver.\\n\\nThat is all. Is it a story? In the next morning\\'s paper I saw a little\\nnews item, and the last sentence of it may help you (as it helped me)\\nto weld the incidents together.\\n\\nIt recounted the reception into Bellevue Hospital of a young woman who\\nhad been removed from No. 49 East ---- street, suffering from debility\\ninduced by starvation. It concluded with these words:\\n\\n\"Dr. William Jackson, the ambulance physician who attended the case,\\nsays the patient will recover.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA SERVICE OF LOVE\\n\\n\\nWhen one loves one\\'s Art no service seems too hard.\\n\\nThat is our premise. This story shall draw a conclusion from it, and\\nshow at the same time that the premise is incorrect. That will be a new\\nthing in logic, and a feat in story-telling somewhat older than the\\ngreat wall of China.\\n\\nJoe Larrabee came out of the post-oak flats of the Middle West pulsing\\nwith a genius for pictorial art. At six he drew a picture of the town\\npump with a prominent citizen passing it hastily. This effort was framed\\nand hung in the drug store window by the side of the ear of corn with an\\nuneven number of rows. At twenty he left for New York with a flowing\\nnecktie and a capital tied up somewhat closer.\\n\\nDelia Caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine-tree\\nvillage in the South that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip\\nhat for her to go \"North\" and \"finish.\" They could not see her f--, but\\nthat is our story.\\n\\nJoe and Delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students\\nhad gathered to discuss chiaroscuro, Wagner, music, Rembrandt\\'s works,\\npictures, Waldteufel, wall paper, Chopin and Oolong.\\n\\nJoe and Delia became enamoured one of the other, or each of the other,\\nas you please, and in a short time were married--for (see above), when\\none loves one\\'s Art no service seems too hard.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Larrabee began housekeeping in a flat. It was a lonesome\\nflat--something like the A sharp way down at the left-hand end of the\\nkeyboard. And they were happy; for they had their Art, and they had each\\nother. And my advice to the rich young man would be--sell all thou hast,\\nand give it to the poor--janitor for the privilege of living in a flat\\nwith your Art and your Delia.\\n\\nFlat-dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true\\nhappiness. If a home is happy it cannot fit too close--let the dresser\\ncollapse and become a billiard table; let the mantel turn to a rowing\\nmachine, the escritoire to a spare bedchamber, the washstand to an\\nupright piano; let the four walls come together, if they will, so you\\nand your Delia are between. But if home be the other kind, let it be\\nwide and long--enter you at the Golden Gate, hang your hat on Hatteras,\\nyour cape on Cape Horn and go out by the Labrador.\\n\\nJoe was painting in the class of the great Magister--you know his fame.\\nHis fees are high; his lessons are light--his high-lights have brought\\nhim renown. Delia was studying under Rosenstock--you know his repute as\\na disturber of the piano keys.\\n\\nThey were mighty happy as long as their money lasted. So is every--but\\nI will not be cynical. Their aims were very clear and defined. Joe was\\nto become capable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen\\nwith thin side-whiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another\\nin his studio for the privilege of buying. Delia was to become familiar\\nand then contemptuous with Music, so that when she saw the orchestra\\nseats and boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a\\nprivate dining-room and refuse to go on the stage.\\n\\nBut the best, in my opinion, was the home life in the little flat--the\\nardent, voluble chats after the day\\'s study; the cozy dinners and fresh,\\nlight breakfasts; the interchange of ambitions--ambitions interwoven\\neach with the other\\'s or else inconsiderable--the mutual help and\\ninspiration; and--overlook my artlessness--stuffed olives and cheese\\nsandwiches at 11 p.m.\\n\\nBut after a while Art flagged. It sometimes does, even if some switchman\\ndoesn\\'t flag it. Everything going out and nothing coming in, as\\nthe vulgarians say. Money was lacking to pay Mr. Magister and Herr\\nRosenstock their prices. When one loves one\\'s Art no service seems too\\nhard. So, Delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing\\ndish bubbling.\\n\\nFor two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils. One evening\\nshe came home elated.\\n\\n\"Joe, dear,\" she said, gleefully, \"I\\'ve a pupil. And, oh, the loveliest\\npeople! General--General A. B. Pinkney\\'s daughter--on Seventy-first\\nstreet. Such a splendid house, Joe--you ought to see the front door!\\nByzantine I think you would call it. And inside! Oh, Joe, I never saw\\nanything like it before.\\n\\n\"My pupil is his daughter Clementina. I dearly love her already. She\\'s\\na delicate thing--dresses always in white; and the sweetest, simplest\\nmanners! Only eighteen years old. I\\'m to give three lessons a week; and,\\njust think, Joe! $5 a lesson. I don\\'t mind it a bit; for when I get two\\nor three more pupils I can resume my lessons with Herr Rosenstock. Now,\\nsmooth out that wrinkle between your brows, dear, and let\\'s have a nice\\nsupper.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right for you, Dele,\" said Joe, attacking a can of peas with\\na carving knife and a hatchet, \"but how about me? Do you think I\\'m going\\nto let you hustle for wages while I philander in the regions of high\\nart? Not by the bones of Benvenuto Cellini! I guess I can sell papers or\\nlay cobblestones, and bring in a dollar or two.\"\\n\\nDelia came and hung about his neck.\\n\\n\"Joe, dear, you are silly. You must keep on at your studies. It is not\\nas if I had quit my music and gone to work at something else. While I\\nteach I learn. I am always with my music. And we can live as happily as\\nmillionaires on $15 a week. You mustn\\'t think of leaving Mr. Magister.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Joe, reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish.\\n\"But I hate for you to be giving lessons. It isn\\'t Art. But you\\'re a\\ntrump and a dear to do it.\"\\n\\n\"When one loves one\\'s Art no service seems too hard,\" said Delia.\\n\\n\"Magister praised the sky in that sketch I made in the park,\" said Joe.\\n\"And Tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window. I may\\nsell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure you will,\" said Delia, sweetly. \"And now let\\'s be thankful for\\nGen. Pinkney and this veal roast.\"\\n\\nDuring all of the next week the Larrabees had an early breakfast. Joe\\nwas enthusiastic about some morning-effect sketches he was doing in\\nCentral Park, and Delia packed him off breakfasted, coddled, praised\\nand kissed at 7 o\\'clock. Art is an engaging mistress. It was most times\\n7 o\\'clock when he returned in the evening.\\n\\nAt the end of the week Delia, sweetly proud but languid, triumphantly\\ntossed three five-dollar bills on the 8x10 (inches) centre table of the\\n8x10 (feet) flat parlour.\\n\\n\"Sometimes,\" she said, a little wearily, \"Clementina tries me. I\\'m\\nafraid she doesn\\'t practise enough, and I have to tell her the same\\nthings so often. And then she always dresses entirely in white, and that\\ndoes get monotonous. But Gen. Pinkney is the dearest old man! I wish you\\ncould know him, Joe. He comes in sometimes when I am with Clementina at\\nthe piano--he is a widower, you know--and stands there pulling his white\\ngoatee. \\'And how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers\\nprogressing?\\' he always asks.\\n\\n\"I wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing-room, Joe! And\\nthose Astrakhan rug portiÃ¨res. And Clementina has such a funny little\\ncough. I hope she is stronger than she looks. Oh, I really am getting\\nattached to her, she is so gentle and high bred. Gen. Pinkney\\'s brother\\nwas once Minister to Bolivia.\"\\n\\nAnd then Joe, with the air of a Monte Cristo, drew forth a ten, a five,\\na two and a one--all legal tender notes--and laid them beside Delia\\'s\\nearnings.\\n\\n\"Sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from Peoria,\" he\\nannounced overwhelmingly.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t joke with me,\" said Delia, \"not from Peoria!\"\\n\\n\"All the way. I wish you could see him, Dele. Fat man with a woollen\\nmuffler and a quill toothpick. He saw the sketch in Tinkle\\'s window and\\nthought it was a windmill at first. He was game, though, and bought it\\nanyhow. He ordered another--an oil sketch of the Lackawanna freight\\ndepot--to take back with him. Music lessons! Oh, I guess Art is still in\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m so glad you\\'ve kept on,\" said Delia, heartily. \"You\\'re bound to\\nwin, dear. Thirty-three dollars! We never had so much to spend before.\\nWe\\'ll have oysters to-night.\"\\n\\n\"And filet mignon with champignons,\" said Joe. \"Where is the olive\\nfork?\"\\n\\nOn the next Saturday evening Joe reached home first. He spread his $18\\non the parlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark\\npaint from his hands.\\n\\nHalf an hour later Delia arrived, her right hand tied up in a shapeless\\nbundle of wraps and bandages.\\n\\n\"How is this?\" asked Joe after the usual greetings. Delia laughed, but\\nnot very joyously.\\n\\n\"Clementina,\" she explained, \"insisted upon a Welsh rabbit after her\\nlesson. She is such a queer girl. Welsh rabbits at 5 in the afternoon.\\nThe General was there. You should have seen him run for the chafing\\ndish, Joe, just as if there wasn\\'t a servant in the house. I know\\nClementina isn\\'t in good health; she is so nervous. In serving the\\nrabbit she spilled a great lot of it, boiling hot, over my hand and\\nwrist. It hurt awfully, Joe. And the dear girl was so sorry! But Gen.\\nPinkney!--Joe, that old man nearly went distracted. He rushed downstairs\\nand sent somebody--they said the furnace man or somebody in the\\nbasement--out to a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up\\nwith. It doesn\\'t hurt so much now.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\" asked Joe, taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some\\nwhite strands beneath the bandages.\\n\\n\"It\\'s something soft,\" said Delia, \"that had oil on it. Oh, Joe, did you\\nsell another sketch?\" She had seen the money on the table.\\n\\n\"Did I?\" said Joe; \"just ask the man from Peoria. He got his depot\\nto-day, and he isn\\'t sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and\\na view on the Hudson. What time this afternoon did you burn your hand,\\nDele?\"\\n\\n\"Five o\\'clock, I think,\" said Dele, plaintively. \"The iron--I mean the\\nrabbit came off the fire about that time. You ought to have seen Gen.\\nPinkney, Joe, when--\"\\n\\n\"Sit down here a moment, Dele,\" said Joe. He drew her to the couch, sat\\nbeside her and put his arm across her shoulders.\\n\\n\"What have you been doing for the last two weeks, Dele?\" he asked.\\n\\nShe braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and\\nstubbornness, and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of Gen. Pinkney;\\nbut at length down went her head and out came the truth and tears.\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t get any pupils,\" she confessed. \"And I couldn\\'t bear to have\\nyou give up your lessons; and I got a place ironing shirts in that big\\nTwenty-fourth street laundry. And I think I did very well to make up\\nboth General Pinkney and Clementina, don\\'t you, Joe? And when a girl in\\nthe laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon I was all the\\nway home making up that story about the Welsh rabbit. You\\'re not angry,\\nare you, Joe? And if I hadn\\'t got the work you mightn\\'t have sold your\\nsketches to that man from Peoria.\"\\n\\n\"He wasn\\'t from Peoria,\" said Joe, slowly.\\n\\n\"Well, it doesn\\'t matter where he was from. How clever you are,\\nJoe--and--kiss me, Joe--and what made you ever suspect that I wasn\\'t\\ngiving music lessons to Clementina?\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t,\" said Joe, \"until to-night. And I wouldn\\'t have then, only I\\nsent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine-room this afternoon\\nfor a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing-iron. I\\'ve\\nbeen firing the engine in that laundry for the last two weeks.\"\\n\\n\"And then you didn\\'t--\"\\n\\n\"My purchaser from Peoria,\" said Joe, \"and Gen. Pinkney are both\\ncreations of the same art--but you wouldn\\'t call it either painting or\\nmusic.\"\\n\\nAnd then they both laughed, and Joe began:\\n\\n\"When one loves one\\'s Art no service seems--\"\\n\\nBut Delia stopped him with her hand on his lips. \"No,\" she said--\"just\\n\\'When one loves.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE COMING-OUT OF MAGGIE\\n\\n\\nEvery Saturday night the Clover Leaf Social Club gave a hop in the\\nhall of the Give and Take Athletic Association on the East Side. In\\norder to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the Give\\nand Take--or, if you belong to the division that starts off with the\\nright foot in waltzing, you must work in Rhinegold\\'s paper-box\\nfactory. Still, any Clover Leaf was privileged to escort or be\\nescorted by an outsider to a single dance. But mostly each Give and\\nTake brought the paper-box girl that he affected; and few strangers\\ncould boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops.\\n\\nMaggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and left-handed\\nstyle of footwork in the two-step, went to the dances with Anna McCarty\\nand her \"fellow.\" Anna and Maggie worked side by side in the factory,\\nand were the greatest chums ever. So Anna always made Jimmy Burns take\\nher by Maggie\\'s house every Saturday night so that her friend could go\\nto the dance with them.\\n\\nThe Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name. The hall\\nof the association in Orchard street was fitted out with muscle-making\\ninventions. With the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to\\nengage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous\\ncombat. Between these more serious occupations the Saturday night hop\\nwith the paper-box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an\\nefficient screen. For sometimes the tip went \\'round, and if you were\\namong the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as\\nneat and satisfying a little welter-weight affair to a finish as ever\\nhappened inside the ropes.\\n\\nOn Saturdays Rhinegold\\'s paper-box factory closed at 3 P. M. On one such\\nafternoon Anna and Maggie walked homeward together. At Maggie\\'s door\\nAnna said, as usual: \"Be ready at seven, sharp, Mag; and Jimmy and me\\'ll\\ncome by for you.\"\\n\\nBut what was this? Instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks\\nfrom the non-escorted one there was to be perceived a high-poised head,\\na prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth, and almost a\\nsparkle in a dull brown eye.\\n\\n\"Thanks, Anna,\" said Maggie; \"but you and Jimmy needn\\'t bother to-night.\\nI\\'ve a gentleman friend that\\'s coming \\'round to escort me to the hop.\"\\n\\nThe comely Anna pounced upon her friend, shook her, chided and beseeched\\nher. Maggie Toole catch a fellow! Plain, dear, loyal, unattractive\\nMaggie, so sweet as a chum, so unsought for a two-step or a moonlit\\nbench in the little park. How was it? When did it happen? Who was it?\\n\\n\"You\\'ll see to-night,\" said Maggie, flushed with the wine of the first\\ngrapes she had gathered in Cupid\\'s vineyard. \"He\\'s swell all right. He\\'s\\ntwo inches taller than Jimmy, and an up-to-date dresser. I\\'ll introduce\\nhim, Anna, just as soon as we get to the hall.\"\\n\\nAnna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening.\\nAnna\\'s eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the\\nfirst glimpse of her friend\\'s \"catch.\"\\n\\nAt 8:30 Miss Toole swept into the hall with her escort. Quickly her\\ntriumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful Jimmy.\\n\\n\"Oh, gee!\" cried Anna, \"Mag ain\\'t made a hit--oh, no! Swell fellow?\\nwell, I guess! Style? Look at \\'um.\"\\n\\n\"Go as far as you like,\" said Jimmy, with sandpaper in his voice. \"Cop\\nhim out if you want him. These new guys always win out with the push.\\nDon\\'t mind me. He don\\'t squeeze all the limes, I guess. Huh!\"\\n\\n\"Shut up, Jimmy. You know what I mean. I\\'m glad for Mag. First fellow\\nshe ever had. Oh, here they come.\"\\n\\nAcross the floor Maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a\\nstately cruiser. And truly, her companion justified the encomiums of the\\nfaithful chum. He stood two inches taller than the average Give and Take\\nathlete; his dark hair curled; his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever\\nhe bestowed his frequent smiles. The young men of the Clover Leaf Club\\npinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did\\nto its prowess, its achievements in hand-to-hand conflicts, and its\\npreservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it. The\\nmember of the association who would bind a paper-box maiden to his\\nconquering chariot scorned to employ Beau Brummel airs. They were not\\nconsidered honourable methods of warfare. The swelling biceps, the coat\\nstraining at its buttons over the chest, the air of conscious conviction\\nof the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation, even a\\ncalm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle\\ntourneys of Cupid--these were the approved arms and ammunition of the\\nClover Leaf gallants. They viewed, then, genuflexions and alluring poses\\nof this visitor with their chins at a new angle.\\n\\n\"A friend of mine, Mr. Terry O\\'Sullivan,\" was Maggie\\'s formula of\\nintroduction. She led him around the room, presenting him to each\\nnew-arriving Clover Leaf. Almost was she pretty now, with the unique\\nluminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and\\na kitten with its first mouse.\\n\\n\"Maggie Toole\\'s got a fellow at last,\" was the word that went round\\namong the paper-box girls. \"Pipe Mag\\'s floor-walker\"--thus the Give and\\nTakes expressed their indifferent contempt.\\n\\nUsually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her\\nback. She felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self-sacrificing\\npartner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and\\ndiminished. She had even grown used to noticing Anna joggle the\\nreluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum\\nto walk over his feet through a two-step.\\n\\nBut to-night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six. Terry O\\'Sullivan\\nwas a victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole winged her first\\nbutterfly flight. And though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with\\nthose of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the\\nrose-crowned melody of Maggie\\'s one perfect night.\\n\\nThe girls besieged her for introductions to her \"fellow.\" The Clover\\nLeaf young men, after two years of blindness, suddenly perceived charms\\nin Miss Toole. They flexed their compelling muscles before her and\\nbespoke her for the dance.\\n\\nThus she scored; but to Terry O\\'Sullivan the honours of the evening fell\\nthick and fast. He shook his curls; he smiled and went easily through\\nthe seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open\\nwindow ten minutes each day. He danced like a faun; he introduced manner\\nand style and atmosphere; his words came trippingly upon his tongue,\\nand--he waltzed twice in succession with the paper-box girl that Dempsey\\nDonovan brought.\\n\\nDempsey was the leader of the association. He wore a dress suit, and\\ncould chin the bar twice with one hand. He was one of \"Big Mike\"\\nO\\'Sullivan\\'s lieutenants, and was never troubled by trouble. No cop\\ndared to arrest him. Whenever he broke a pushcart man\\'s head or shot a\\nmember of the Heinrick B. Sweeney Outing and Literary Association in\\nthe kneecap, an officer would drop around and say:\\n\\n\"The Cap\\'n \\'d like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye\\nhave time, Dempsey, me boy.\"\\n\\nBut there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and\\nblack cigars; and somebody would tell a funny story, and then Dempsey\\nwould go back and work half an hour with the six-pound dumbbells. So,\\ndoing a tight-rope act on a wire stretched across Niagara was a safe\\nterpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with Dempsey\\nDonovan\\'s paper-box girl. At 10 o\\'clock the jolly round face of \"Big\\nMike\" O\\'Sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene. He\\nalways looked in for five minutes, smiled at the girls and handed out\\nreal perfectos to the delighted boys.\\n\\nDempsey Donovan was at his elbow instantly, talking rapidly. \"Big Mike\"\\nlooked carefully at the dancers, smiled, shook his head and departed.\\n\\nThe music stopped. The dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls.\\nTerry O\\'Sullivan, with his entrancing bow, relinquished a pretty girl in\\nblue to her partner and started back to find Maggie. Dempsey intercepted\\nhim in the middle of the floor.\\n\\nSome fine instinct that Rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly\\nevery one to turn and look at them--there was a subtle feeling that two\\ngladiators had met in the arena. Two or three Give and Takes with tight\\ncoat sleeves drew nearer.\\n\\n\"One moment, Mr. O\\'Sullivan,\" said Dempsey. \"I hope you\\'re enjoying\\nyourself. Where did you say you live?\"\\n\\nThe two gladiators were well matched. Dempsey had, perhaps, ten\\npounds of weight to give away. The O\\'Sullivan had breadth with\\nquickness. Dempsey had a glacial eye, a dominating slit of a mouth, an\\nindestructible jaw, a complexion like a belle\\'s and the coolness of a\\nchampion. The visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control\\nover his conspicuous sneer. They were enemies by the law written when\\nthe rocks were molten. They were each too splendid, too mighty, too\\nincomparable to divide pre-eminence. One only must survive.\\n\\n\"I live on Grand,\" said O\\'Sullivan, insolently; \"and no trouble to find\\nme at home. Where do you live?\"\\n\\nDempsey ignored the question.\\n\\n\"You say your name\\'s O\\'Sullivan,\" he went on. \"Well, \\'Big Mike\\' says he\\nnever saw you before.\"\\n\\n\"Lots of things he never saw,\" said the favourite of the hop.\\n\\n\"As a rule,\" went on Dempsey, huskily sweet, \"O\\'Sullivans in this\\ndistrict know one another. You escorted one of our lady members here,\\nand we want a chance to make good. If you\\'ve got a family tree let\\'s\\nsee a few historical O\\'Sullivan buds come out on it. Or do you want\\nus to dig it out of you by the roots?\"\\n\\n\"Suppose you mind your own business,\" suggested O\\'Sullivan, blandly.\\n\\nDempsey\\'s eye brightened. He held up an inspired forefinger as though a\\nbrilliant idea had struck him.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got it now,\" he said cordially. \"It was just a little mistake. You\\nain\\'t no O\\'Sullivan. You are a ring-tailed monkey. Excuse us for not\\nrecognising you at first.\"\\n\\nO\\'Sullivan\\'s eye flashed. He made a quick movement, but Andy Geoghan was\\nready and caught his arm.\\n\\nDempsey nodded at Andy and William McMahan, the secretary of the club,\\nand walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall. Two other\\nmembers of the Give and Take Association swiftly joined the little\\ngroup. Terry O\\'Sullivan was now in the hands of the Board of Rules and\\nSocial Referees. They spoke to him briefly and softly, and conducted\\nhim out through the same door at the rear.\\n\\nThis movement on the part of the Clover Leaf members requires a word of\\nelucidation. Back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by\\nthe club. In this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom\\nfloor were settled, man to man, with the weapons of nature, under the\\nsupervision of the board. No lady could say that she had witnessed a\\nfight at a Clover Leaf hop in several years. Its gentlemen members\\nguaranteed that.\\n\\nSo easily and smoothly had Dempsey and the board done their preliminary\\nwork that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the\\nfascinating O\\'Sullivan\\'s social triumph. Among these was Maggie. She\\nlooked about for her escort.\\n\\n\"Smoke up!\" said Rose Cassidy. \"Wasn\\'t you on? Demps Donovan picked a\\nscrap with your Lizzie-boy, and they\\'ve waltzed out to the slaughter\\nroom with him. How\\'s my hair look done up this way, Mag?\"\\n\\nMaggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist.\\n\\n\"Gone to fight with Dempsey!\" she said, breathlessly. \"They\\'ve got to be\\nstopped. Dempsey Donovan can\\'t fight him. Why, he\\'ll--he\\'ll kill him!\"\\n\\n\"Ah, what do you care?\" said Rosa. \"Don\\'t some of \\'em fight every hop?\"\\n\\nBut Maggie was off, darting her zig-zag way through the maze of dancers.\\nShe burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her\\nsolid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat. It gave\\nway, and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene--the\\nBoard standing about with open watches; Dempsey Donovan in his shirt\\nsleeves dancing, light-footed, with the wary grace of the modern\\npugilist, within easy reach of his adversary; Terry O\\'Sullivan\\nstanding with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes. And\\nwithout slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a\\nscream--leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of O\\'Sullivan that\\nwas suddenly uplifted, and to whisk from it the long, bright stiletto\\nthat he had drawn from his bosom.\\n\\nThe knife fell and rang upon the floor. Cold steel drawn in the rooms of\\nthe Give and Take Association! Such a thing had never happened before.\\nEvery one stood motionless for a minute. Andy Geoghan kicked the\\nstiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously, like an antiquarian who has\\ncome upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning.\\n\\nAnd then O\\'Sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth.\\nDempsey and the board exchanged looks. And then Dempsey looked at\\nO\\'Sullivan without anger, as one looks at a stray dog, and nodded his\\nhead in the direction of the door.\\n\\n\"The back stairs, Giuseppi,\" he said, briefly. \"Somebody\\'ll pitch your\\nhat down after you.\"\\n\\nMaggie walked up to Dempsey Donovan. There was a brilliant spot of red\\nin her cheeks, down which slow tears were running. But she looked him\\nbravely in the eye.\\n\\n\"I knew it, Dempsey,\" she said, as her eyes grew dull even in their\\ntears. \"I knew he was a Guinea. His name\\'s Tony Spinelli. I hurried in\\nwhen they told me you and him was scrappin\\'. Them Guineas always carries\\nknives. But you don\\'t understand, Dempsey. I never had a fellow in my\\nlife. I got tired of comin\\' with Anna and Jimmy every night, so I fixed\\nit with him to call himself O\\'Sullivan, and brought him along. I knew\\nthere\\'d be nothin\\' doin\\' for him if he came as a Dago. I guess I\\'ll\\nresign from the club now.\"\\n\\nDempsey turned to Andy Geoghan.\\n\\n\"Chuck that cheese slicer out of the window,\" he said, \"and tell \\'em\\ninside that Mr. O\\'Sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to\\nTammany Hall.\"\\n\\nAnd then he turned back to Maggie.\\n\\n\"Say, Mag,\" he said, \"I\\'ll see you home. And how about next Saturday\\nnight? Will you come to the hop with me if I call around for you?\"\\n\\nIt was remarkable how quickly Maggie\\'s eyes could change from dull to\\na shining brown.\\n\\n\"With you, Dempsey?\" she stammered. \"Say--will a duck swim?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMAN ABOUT TOWN\\n\\n\\nThere were two or three things that I wanted to know. I do not care\\nabout a mystery. So I began to inquire.\\n\\nIt took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases.\\nAnd then I began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces. This\\nserious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded\\nlike a conundrum. I was at last assured that its double form of\\nconstruction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman, who makes\\nup beds. I was so foolish as to persist, begging to know why, then, they\\nwere not made in two equal pieces; whereupon I was shunned.\\n\\nThe third draught that I craved from the fount of knowledge was\\nenlightenment concerning the character known as A Man About Town. He was\\nmore vague in my mind than a type should be. We must have a concrete\\nidea of anything, even if it be an imaginary idea, before we can\\ncomprehend it. Now, I have a mental picture of John Doe that is as clear\\nas a steel engraving. His eyes are weak blue; he wears a brown vest\\nand a shiny black serge coat. He stands always in the sunshine chewing\\nsomething; and he keeps half-shutting his pocket knife and opening it\\nagain with his thumb. And, if the Man Higher Up is ever found, take\\nmy assurance for it, he will be a large, pale man with blue wristlets\\nshowing under his cuffs, and he will be sitting to have his shoes\\npolished within sound of a bowling alley, and there will be somewhere\\nabout him turquoises.\\n\\nBut the canvas of my imagination, when it came to limning the Man About\\nTown, was blank. I fancied that he had a detachable sneer (like the\\nsmile of the Cheshire cat) and attached cuffs; and that was all.\\nWhereupon I asked a newspaper reporter about him.\\n\\n\"Why,\" said he, \"a \\'Man About Town\\' something between a \\'rounder\\' and\\na \\'clubman.\\' He isn\\'t exactly--well, he fits in between Mrs. Fish\\'s\\nreceptions and private boxing bouts. He doesn\\'t--well, he doesn\\'t belong\\neither to the Lotos Club or to the Jerry McGeogheghan Galvanised Iron\\nWorkers\\' Apprentices\\' Left Hook Chowder Association. I don\\'t exactly\\nknow how to describe him to you. You\\'ll see him everywhere there\\'s\\nanything doing. Yes, I suppose he\\'s a type. Dress clothes every evening;\\nknows the ropes; calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first\\nnames. No; he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives. You generally\\nsee him alone or with another man.\"\\n\\nMy friend the reporter left me, and I wandered further afield. By this\\ntime the 3126 electric lights on the Rialto were alight. People passed,\\nbut they held me not. Paphian eyes rayed upon me, and left me unscathed.\\nDiners, heimgangers, shop-girls, confidence men, panhandlers, actors,\\nhighwaymen, millionaires and outlanders hurried, skipped, strolled,\\nsneaked, swaggered and scurried by me; but I took no note of them. I\\nknew them all; I had read their hearts; they had served. I wanted my Man\\nAbout Town. He was a type, and to drop him would be an error--a\\ntypograph--but no! let us continue.\\n\\nLet us continue with a moral digression. To see a family reading the\\nSunday paper gratifies. The sections have been separated. Papa is\\nearnestly scanning the page that pictures the young lady exercising\\nbefore an open window, and bending--but there, there! Mamma is\\ninterested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word N_w Yo_k.\\nThe oldest girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports, for a\\ncertain young man remarked last Sunday night that he had taken a flyer\\nin Q., X. & Z. Willie, the eighteen-year-old son, who attends the New\\nYork public school, is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to\\nmake over an old skirt, for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on\\ngraduation day.\\n\\nGrandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two-hours\\' grip; and\\nlittle Tottie, the baby, is rocking along the best she can with the real\\nestate transfers. This view is intended to be reassuring, for it is\\ndesirable that a few lines of this story be skipped. For it introduces\\nstrong drink.\\n\\nI went into a cafÃ© to--and while it was being mixed I asked the man\\nwho grabs up your hot Scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what\\nhe understood by the term, epithet, description, designation,\\ncharacterisation or appellation, viz.: a \"Man About Town.\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" said he, carefully, \"it means a fly guy that\\'s wise to the\\nall-night push--see? It\\'s a hot sport that you can\\'t bump to the rail\\nanywhere between the Flatirons--see? I guess that\\'s about what it\\nmeans.\"\\n\\nI thanked him and departed.\\n\\nOn the sidewalk a Salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle\\ngently against my waistcoat pocket.\\n\\n\"Would you mind telling me,\" I asked her, \"if you ever meet with the\\ncharacter commonly denominated as \\'A Man About Town\\' during your daily\\nwanderings?\"\\n\\n\"I think I know whom you mean,\" she answered, with a gentle smile. \"We\\nsee them in the same places night after night. They are the devil\\'s body\\nguard, and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as they are,\\ntheir commanders are well served. We go among them, diverting a few\\npennies from their wickedness to the Lord\\'s service.\"\\n\\nShe shook the box again and I dropped a dime into it.\\n\\nIn front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine, a critic, was climbing\\nfrom a cab. He seemed at leisure; and I put my question to him. He\\nanswered me conscientiously, as I was sure he would.\\n\\n\"There is a type of \\'Man About Town\\' in New York,\" he answered. \"The\\nterm is quite familiar to me, but I don\\'t think I was ever called upon\\nto define the character before. It would be difficult to point you out\\nan exact specimen. I would say, offhand, that it is a man who had a\\nhopeless case of the peculiar New York disease of wanting to see and\\nknow. At 6 o\\'clock each day life begins with him. He follows rigidly the\\nconventions of dress and manners; but in the business of poking his nose\\ninto places where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet\\ncat or a jackdaw. He is the man who has chased Bohemia about the town\\nfrom rathskeller to roof garden and from Hester street to Harlem until\\nyou can\\'t find a place in the city where they don\\'t cut their spaghetti\\nwith a knife. Your \\'Man About Town\\' has done that. He is always on the\\nscent of something new. He is curiosity, impudence and omnipresence.\\nHansoms were made for him, and gold-banded cigars; and the curse of\\nmusic at dinner. There are not so many of him; but his minority report\\nis adopted everywhere.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you brought up the subject; I\\'ve felt the influence of this\\nnocturnal blight upon our city, but I never thought to analyse it\\nbefore. I can see now that your \\'Man About Town\\' should have been\\nclassified long ago. In his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models;\\nand the orchestra plays \\'Let\\'s All Go Up to Maud\\'s\\' for him, by request,\\ninstead of HÃ¤ndel. He makes his rounds every evening; while you and I\\nsee the elephant once a week. When the cigar store is raided, he winks\\nat the officer, familiar with his ground, and walks away immune, while\\nyou and I search among the Presidents for names, and among the stars for\\naddresses to give the desk sergeant.\"\\n\\nMy friend, the critic, paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence.\\nI seized my advantage.\\n\\n\"You have classified him,\" I cried with joy. \"You have painted his\\nportrait in the gallery of city types. But I must meet one face to face.\\nI must study the Man About Town at first hand. Where shall I find him?\\nHow shall I know him?\"\\n\\nWithout seeming to hear me, the critic went on. And his cab-driver was\\nwaiting for his fare, too.\\n\\n\"He is the sublimated essence of Butt-in; the refined, intrinsic extract\\nof Rubber; the concentrated, purified, irrefutable, unavoidable spirit\\nof Curiosity and Inquisitiveness. A new sensation is the breath in his\\nnostrils; when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with\\nthe indefatigability of a--\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" I interrupted, \"but can you produce one of this type? It is\\na new thing to me. I must study it. I will search the town over until I\\nfind one. Its habitat must be here on Broadway.\"\\n\\n\"I am about to dine here,\" said my friend. \"Come inside, and if there is\\na Man About Town present I will point him out to you. I know most of the\\nregular patrons here.\"\\n\\n\"I am not dining yet,\" I said to him. \"You will excuse me. I am going to\\nfind my Man About Town this night if I have to rake New York from the\\nBattery to Little Coney Island.\"\\n\\nI left the hotel and walked down Broadway. The pursuit of my type gave a\\npleasant savour of life and interest to the air I breathed. I was glad\\nto be in a city so great, so complex and diversified. Leisurely and\\nwith something of an air I strolled along with my heart expanding at\\nthe thought that I was a citizen of great Gotham, a sharer in its\\nmagnificence and pleasures, a partaker in its glory and prestige.\\n\\nI turned to cross the street. I heard something buzz like a bee, and\\nthen I took a long, pleasant ride with Santos-Dumont.\\n\\nWhen I opened my eyes I remembered a smell of gasoline, and I said\\naloud: \"Hasn\\'t it passed yet?\"\\n\\nA hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow\\nthat was not at all fevered. A young doctor came along, grinned, and\\nhanded me a morning newspaper.\\n\\n\"Want to see how it happened?\" he asked cheerily. I read the article.\\nIts headlines began where I heard the buzzing leave off the night\\nbefore. It closed with these lines:\\n\\n\"--Bellevue Hospital, where it was said that his injuries were not\\nserious. He appeared to be a typical Man About Town.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE COP AND THE ANTHEM\\n\\nOn his bench in Madison Square Soapy moved uneasily. When wild geese\\nhonk high of nights, and when women without sealskin coats grow kind\\nto their husbands, and when Soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the\\npark, you may know that winter is near at hand.\\n\\nA dead leaf fell in Soapy\\'s lap. That was Jack Frost\\'s card. Jack is\\nkind to the regular denizens of Madison Square, and gives fair warning\\nof his annual call. At the corners of four streets he hands his\\npasteboard to the North Wind, footman of the mansion of All Outdoors,\\nso that the inhabitants thereof may make ready.\\n\\nSoapy\\'s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for\\nhim to resolve himself into a singular Committee of Ways and Means to\\nprovide against the coming rigour. And therefore he moved uneasily\\non his bench.\\n\\nThe hibernatorial ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. In them\\nthere were no considerations of Mediterranean cruises, of soporific\\nSouthern skies drifting in the Vesuvian Bay. Three months on the Island\\nwas what his soul craved. Three months of assured board and bed and\\ncongenial company, safe from Boreas and bluecoats, seemed to Soapy the\\nessence of things desirable.\\n\\nFor years the hospitable Blackwell\\'s had been his winter quarters. Just\\nas his more fortunate fellow New Yorkers had bought their tickets to\\nPalm Beach and the Riviera each winter, so Soapy had made his humble\\narrangements for his annual hegira to the Island. And now the time\\nwas come. On the previous night three Sabbath newspapers, distributed\\nbeneath his coat, about his ankles and over his lap, had failed to\\nrepulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain\\nin the ancient square. So the Island loomed big and timely in Soapy\\'s\\nmind. He scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the\\ncity\\'s dependents. In Soapy\\'s opinion the Law was more benign than\\nPhilanthropy. There was an endless round of institutions, municipal and\\neleemosynary, on which he might set out and receive lodging and food\\naccordant with the simple life. But to one of Soapy\\'s proud spirit\\nthe gifts of charity are encumbered. If not in coin you must pay in\\nhumiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of\\nphilanthropy. As Caesar had his Brutus, every bed of charity must have\\nits toll of a bath, every loaf of bread its compensation of a private\\nand personal inquisition. Wherefore it is better to be a guest of the\\nlaw, which though conducted by rules, does not meddle unduly with a\\ngentleman\\'s private affairs.\\n\\nSoapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about\\naccomplishing his desire. There were many easy ways of doing this.\\nThe pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant;\\nand then, after declaring insolvency, be handed over quietly and\\nwithout uproar to a policeman. An accommodating magistrate would do\\nthe rest.\\n\\nSoapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the\\nlevel sea of asphalt, where Broadway and Fifth Avenue flow together. Up\\nBroadway he turned, and halted at a glittering cafÃ©, where are gathered\\ntogether nightly the choicest products of the grape, the silkworm and\\nthe protoplasm.\\n\\nSoapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest\\nupward. He was shaven, and his coat was decent and his neat black,\\nready-tied four-in-hand had been presented to him by a lady missionary\\non Thanksgiving Day. If he could reach a table in the restaurant\\nunsuspected success would be his. The portion of him that would show\\nabove the table would raise no doubt in the waiter\\'s mind. A roasted\\nmallard duck, thought Soapy, would be about the thing--with a bottle of\\nChablis, and then Camembert, a demi-tasse and a cigar. One dollar for\\nthe cigar would be enough. The total would not be so high as to call\\nforth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafÃ© management; and\\nyet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his\\nwinter refuge.\\n\\nBut as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter\\'s eye\\nfell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes. Strong and ready hands\\nturned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk\\nand averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard.\\n\\nSoapy turned off Broadway. It seemed that his route to the coveted\\nisland was not to be an epicurean one. Some other way of entering\\nlimbo must be thought of.\\n\\nAt a corner of Sixth Avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed\\nwares behind plate-glass made a shop window conspicuous. Soapy took a\\ncobblestone and dashed it through the glass. People came running around\\nthe corner, a policeman in the lead. Soapy stood still, with his hands\\nin his pockets, and smiled at the sight of brass buttons.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the man that done that?\" inquired the officer excitedly.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you figure out that I might have had something to do with it?\"\\nsaid Soapy, not without sarcasm, but friendly, as one greets good\\nfortune.\\n\\nThe policeman\\'s mind refused to accept Soapy even as a clue. Men who\\nsmash windows do not remain to parley with the law\\'s minions. They take\\nto their heels. The policeman saw a man half way down the block running\\nto catch a car. With drawn club he joined in the pursuit. Soapy, with\\ndisgust in his heart, loafed along, twice unsuccessful.\\n\\nOn the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great\\npretensions. It catered to large appetites and modest purses. Its\\ncrockery and atmosphere were thick; its soup and napery thin. Into\\nthis place Soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without\\nchallenge. At a table he sat and consumed beefsteak, flapjacks,\\ndoughnuts and pie. And then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that\\nthe minutest coin and himself were strangers.\\n\\n\"Now, get busy and call a cop,\" said Soapy. \"And don\\'t keep a gentleman\\nwaiting.\"\\n\\n\"No cop for youse,\" said the waiter, with a voice like butter cakes and\\nan eye like the cherry in a Manhattan cocktail. \"Hey, Con!\"\\n\\nNeatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched\\nSoapy. He arose, joint by joint, as a carpenter\\'s rule opens, and beat\\nthe dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed but a rosy dream. The Island\\nseemed very far away. A policeman who stood before a drug store two\\ndoors away laughed and walked down the street.\\n\\nFive blocks Soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo\\ncapture again. This time the opportunity presented what he fatuously\\ntermed to himself a \"cinch.\" A young woman of a modest and pleasing\\nguise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest\\nat its display of shaving mugs and inkstands, and two yards from the\\nwindow a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water\\nplug.\\n\\nIt was Soapy\\'s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated\\n\"masher.\" The refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the\\ncontiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he\\nwould soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would\\ninsure his winter quarters on the right little, tight little isle.\\n\\nSoapy straightened the lady missionary\\'s ready-made tie, dragged his\\nshrinking cuffs into the open, set his hat at a killing cant and sidled\\ntoward the young woman. He made eyes at her, was taken with sudden\\ncoughs and \"hems,\" smiled, smirked and went brazenly through the\\nimpudent and contemptible litany of the \"masher.\" With half an eye Soapy\\nsaw that the policeman was watching him fixedly. The young woman moved\\naway a few steps, and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the\\nshaving mugs. Soapy followed, boldly stepping to her side, raised his\\nhat and said:\\n\\n\"Ah there, Bedelia! Don\\'t you want to come and play in my yard?\"\\n\\nThe policeman was still looking. The persecuted young woman had but to\\nbeckon a finger and Soapy would be practically en route for his insular\\nhaven. Already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the\\nstation-house. The young woman faced him and, stretching out a hand,\\ncaught Soapy\\'s coat sleeve.\\n\\n\"Sure, Mike,\" she said joyfully, \"if you\\'ll blow me to a pail of suds.\\nI\\'d have spoke to you sooner, but the cop was watching.\"\\n\\nWith the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak Soapy walked\\npast the policeman overcome with gloom. He seemed doomed to liberty.\\n\\nAt the next corner he shook off his companion and ran. He halted in the\\ndistrict where by night are found the lightest streets, hearts, vows and\\nlibrettos. Women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry\\nair. A sudden fear seized Soapy that some dreadful enchantment had\\nrendered him immune to arrest. The thought brought a little of panic\\nupon it, and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in\\nfront of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of\\n\"disorderly conduct.\"\\n\\nOn the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his\\nharsh voice. He danced, howled, raved and otherwise disturbed the\\nwelkin.\\n\\nThe policeman twirled his club, turned his back to Soapy and remarked to\\na citizen.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis one of them Yale lads celebratin\\' the goose egg they give to the\\nHartford College. Noisy; but no harm. We\\'ve instructions to lave them\\nbe.\"\\n\\nDisconsolate, Soapy ceased his unavailing racket. Would never a\\npoliceman lay hands on him? In his fancy the Island seemed an\\nunattainable Arcadia. He buttoned his thin coat against the chilling\\nwind.\\n\\nIn a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man lighting a cigar at a\\nswinging light. His silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering.\\nSoapy stepped inside, secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it\\nslowly. The man at the cigar light followed hastily.\\n\\n\"My umbrella,\" he said, sternly.\\n\\n\"Oh, is it?\" sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny. \"Well, why\\ndon\\'t you call a policeman? I took it. Your umbrella! Why don\\'t you call\\na cop? There stands one on the corner.\"\\n\\nThe umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with a\\npresentiment that luck would again run against him. The policeman\\nlooked at the two curiously.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said the umbrella man--\"that is--well, you know how these\\nmistakes occur--I--if it\\'s your umbrella I hope you\\'ll excuse me--I\\npicked it up this morning in a restaurant--If you recognise it as yours,\\nwhy--I hope you\\'ll--\"\\n\\n\"Of course it\\'s mine,\" said Soapy, viciously.\\n\\nThe ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to assist a tall\\nblonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that\\nwas approaching two blocks away.\\n\\nSoapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements. He\\nhurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation. He muttered against\\nthe men who wear helmets and carry clubs. Because he wanted to fall into\\ntheir clutches, they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no\\nwrong.\\n\\nAt length Soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter\\nand turmoil was but faint. He set his face down this toward Madison\\nSquare, for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park\\nbench.\\n\\nBut on an unusually quiet corner Soapy came to a standstill. Here was an\\nold church, quaint and rambling and gabled. Through one violet-stained\\nwindow a soft light glowed, where, no doubt, the organist loitered over\\nthe keys, making sure of his mastery of the coming Sabbath anthem. For\\nthere drifted out to Soapy\\'s ears sweet music that caught and held him\\ntransfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence.\\n\\nThe moon was above, lustrous and serene; vehicles and pedestrians were\\nfew; sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves--for a little while the\\nscene might have been a country churchyard. And the anthem that the\\norganist played cemented Soapy to the iron fence, for he had known it\\nwell in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and\\nroses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars.\\n\\nThe conjunction of Soapy\\'s receptive state of mind and the influences\\nabout the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul.\\nHe viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled, the\\ndegraded days, unworthy desires, dead hopes, wrecked faculties and base\\nmotives that made up his existence.\\n\\nAnd also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel\\nmood. An instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with\\nhis desperate fate. He would pull himself out of the mire; he would\\nmake a man of himself again; he would conquer the evil that had taken\\npossession of him. There was time; he was comparatively young yet;\\nhe would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without\\nfaltering. Those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in\\nhim. To-morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find\\nwork. A fur importer had once offered him a place as driver. He would\\nfind him to-morrow and ask for the position. He would be somebody in the\\nworld. He would--\\n\\nSoapy felt a hand laid on his arm. He looked quickly around into the\\nbroad face of a policeman.\\n\\n\"What are you doin\\' here?\" asked the officer.\\n\\n\"Nothin\\',\" said Soapy.\\n\\n\"Then come along,\" said the policeman.\\n\\n\"Three months on the Island,\" said the Magistrate in the Police Court\\nthe next morning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAN ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE\\n\\n\\nIn an art exhibition the other day I saw a painting that had been\\nsold for $5,000. The painter was a young scrub out of the West named\\nKraft, who had a favourite food and a pet theory. His pabulum was an\\nunquenchable belief in the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature. His\\ntheory was fixed around corned-beef hash with poached egg. There was\\na story behind the picture, so I went home and let it drip out of a\\nfountain-pen. The idea of Kraft--but that is not the beginning of the\\nstory.\\n\\nThree years ago Kraft, Bill Judkins (a poet), and I took our meals at\\nCypher\\'s, on Eighth Avenue. I say \"took.\" When we had money, Cypher got\\nit \"off of\" us, as he expressed it. We had no credit; we went in, called\\nfor food and ate it. We paid or we did not pay. We had confidence in\\nCypher\\'s sullenness and smouldering ferocity. Deep down in his sunless\\nsoul he was either a prince, a fool or an artist. He sat at a worm-eaten\\ndesk, covered with files of waiters\\' checks so old that I was sure the\\nbottomest one was for clams that Hendrik Hudson had eaten and paid for.\\nCypher had the power, in common with Napoleon III. and the goggle-eyed\\nperch, of throwing a film over his eyes, rendering opaque the windows of\\nhis soul. Once when we left him unpaid, with egregious excuses, I looked\\nback and saw him shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film. Now\\nand then we paid up back scores.\\n\\nBut the chief thing at Cypher\\'s was Milly. Milly was a waitress. She\\nwas a grand example of Kraft\\'s theory of the artistic adjustment of\\nnature. She belonged, largely, to waiting, as Minerva did to the art of\\nscrapping, or Venus to the science of serious flirtation. Pedestalled\\nand in bronze she might have stood with the noblest of her heroic\\nsisters as \"Liver-and-Bacon Enlivening the World.\" She belonged to\\nCypher\\'s. You expected to see her colossal figure loom through that\\nreeking blue cloud of smoke from frying fat just as you expect the\\nPalisades to appear through a drifting Hudson River fog. There amid the\\nsteam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of \"ham and,\" the crash of\\ncrockery, the clatter of steel, the screaming of \"short orders,\" the\\ncries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of feeding man,\\nsurrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by\\nPharaoh, Milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner\\ncleaving among the canoes of howling savages.\\n\\nOur Goddess of Grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be\\nfollowed only with awe. Her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows.\\nShe could have taken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped\\nus out of the window. She had seen fewer years than any of us, but she\\nwas of such superb Evehood and simplicity that she mothered us from the\\nbeginning. Cypher\\'s store of eatables she poured out upon us with royal\\nindifference to price and quantity, as from a cornucopia that knew no\\nexhaustion. Her voice rang like a great silver bell; her smile was\\nmany-toothed and frequent; she seemed like a yellow sunrise on mountain\\ntops. I never saw her but I thought of the Yosemite. And yet, somehow, I\\ncould never think of her as existing outside of Cypher\\'s. There nature\\nhad placed her, and she had taken root and grown mightily. She seemed\\nhappy, and took her few poor dollars on Saturday nights with the flushed\\npleasure of a child that receives an unexpected donation.\\n\\nIt was Kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held\\nlatently. It came up apropos, of course, of certain questions of art at\\nwhich we were hammering. One of us compared the harmony existing between\\na Haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity\\nbetween Milly and Cypher\\'s.\\n\\n\"There is a certain fate hanging over Milly,\" said Kraft, \"and if it\\novertakes her she is lost to Cypher\\'s and to us.\"\\n\\n\"She will grow fat?\" asked Judkins, fearsomely.\\n\\n\"She will go to night school and become refined?\" I ventured anxiously.\\n\\n\"It is this,\" said Kraft, punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee with\\na stiff forefinger. \"Caesar had his Brutus--the cotton has its bollworm,\\nthe chorus girl has her Pittsburger, the summer boarder has his poison\\nivy, the hero has his Carnegie medal, art has its Morgan, the rose has\\nits--\"\\n\\n\"Speak,\" I interrupted, much perturbed. \"You do not think that Milly\\nwill begin to lace?\"\\n\\n\"One day,\" concluded Kraft, solemnly, \"there will come to Cypher\\'s for a\\nplate of beans a millionaire lumberman from Wisconsin, and he will marry\\nMilly.\"\\n\\n\"Never!\" exclaimed Judkins and I, in horror.\\n\\n\"A lumberman,\" repeated Kraft, hoarsely.\\n\\n\"And a millionaire lumberman!\" I sighed, despairingly.\\n\\n\"From Wisconsin!\" groaned Judkins.\\n\\nWe agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her. Few things were less\\nimprobable. Milly, like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods, was\\nmade to catch the lumberman\\'s eye. And well we knew the habits of the\\nBadgers, once fortune smiled upon them. Straight to New York they hie,\\nand lay their goods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a\\nbeanery. Why, the alphabet itself connives. The Sunday newspaper\\'s\\nheadliner\\'s work is cut for him.\\n\\n\"Winsome Waitress Wins Wealthy Wisconsin Woodsman.\"\\n\\nFor a while we felt that Milly was on the verge of being lost to us.\\n\\nIt was our love of the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature that\\ninspired us. We could not give her over to a lumberman, doubly accursed\\nby wealth and provincialism. We shuddered to think of Milly, with her\\nvoice modulated and her elbows covered, pouring tea in the marble teepee\\nof a tree murderer. No! In Cypher\\'s she belonged--in the bacon smoke,\\nthe cabbage perfume, the grand, Wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone\\nchina and rattling casters.\\n\\nOur fears must have been prophetic, for on that same evening the\\nwildwood discharged upon us Milly\\'s preordained confiscator--our fee to\\nadjustment and order. But Alaska and not Wisconsin bore the burden of\\nthe visitation.\\n\\nWe were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in\\nas if on the heels of a dog team, and made one of the mess at our table.\\nWith the freedom of the camps he assaulted our ears and claimed the\\nfellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house. We embraced him as\\na specimen, and in three minutes we had all but died for one another as\\nfriends.\\n\\nHe was rugged and bearded and wind-dried. He had just come off the\\n\"trail,\" he said, at one of the North River ferries. I fancied I could\\nsee the snow dust of Chilcoot yet powdering his shoulders. And then he\\nstrewed the table with the nuggets, stuffed ptarmigans, bead work and\\nseal pelts of the returned Klondiker, and began to prate to us of his\\nmillions.\\n\\n\"Bank drafts for two millions,\" was his summing up, \"and a thousand a\\nday piling up from my claims. And now I want some beef stew and canned\\npeaches. I never got off the train since I mushed out of Seattle, and\\nI\\'m hungry. The stuff the niggers feed you on Pullmans don\\'t count. You\\ngentlemen order what you want.\"\\n\\nAnd then Milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare arm--loomed\\nup big and white and pink and awful as Mount Saint Elias--with a smile\\nlike day breaking in a gulch. And the Klondiker threw down his pelts\\nand nuggets as dross, and let his jaw fall half-way, and stared at\\nher. You could almost see the diamond tiaras on Milly\\'s brow and the\\nhand-embroidered silk Paris gowns that he meant to buy for her.\\n\\nAt last the bollworm had attacked the cotton--the poison ivy was\\nreaching out its tendrils to entwine the summer boarder--the millionaire\\nlumberman, thinly disguised as the Alaskan miner, was about to engulf\\nour Milly and upset Nature\\'s adjustment.\\n\\nKraft was the first to act. He leaped up and pounded the Klondiker\\'s\\nback. \"Come out and drink,\" he shouted. \"Drink first and eat afterward.\"\\nJudkins seized one arm and I the other. Gaily, roaringly, irresistibly,\\nin jolly-good-fellow style, we dragged him from the restaurant to a\\ncafÃ©, stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible\\nnuggets.\\n\\nThere he rumbled a roughly good-humoured protest. \"That\\'s the girl for\\nmy money,\" he declared. \"She can eat out of my skillet the rest of her\\nlife. Why, I never see such a fine girl. I\\'m going back there and ask\\nher to marry me. I guess she won\\'t want to sling hash any more when she\\nsees the pile of dust I\\'ve got.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll take another whiskey and milk now,\" Kraft persuaded, with\\nSatan\\'s smile. \"I thought you up-country fellows were better sports.\"\\n\\nKraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave Judkins and\\nme such an appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in\\ntoasting our guest.\\n\\nThen, when our ammunition was gone and the Klondiker, still somewhat\\nsober, began to babble again of Milly, Kraft whispered into his ear such\\na polite, barbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their\\nfunds, that the miner crashed down handful after handful of silver and\\nnotes, calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation.\\n\\nThus the work was accomplished. With his own guns we drove him from the\\nfield. And then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to\\nbed with his nuggets and baby seal-skins stuffed around him.\\n\\n\"He will never find Cypher\\'s again,\" said Kraft. \"He will propose to the\\nfirst white apron he sees in a dairy restaurant to-morrow. And Milly--I\\nmean the Natural Adjustment--is saved!\"\\n\\nAnd back to Cypher\\'s went we three, and, finding customers scarce, we\\njoined hands and did an Indian dance with Milly in the centre.\\n\\nThis, I say, happened three years ago. And about that time a little luck\\ndescended upon us three, and we were enabled to buy costlier and less\\nwholesome food than Cypher\\'s. Our paths separated, and I saw Kraft no\\nmore and Judkins seldom.\\n\\nBut, as I said, I saw a painting the other day that was sold for\\n$5,000. The title was \"Boadicea,\" and the figure seemed to fill all\\nout-of-doors. But of all the picture\\'s admirers who stood before it, I\\nbelieve I was the only one who longed for Boadicea to stalk from her\\nframe, bringing me corned-beef hash with poached egg.\\n\\nI hurried away to see Kraft. His satanic eyes were the same, his hair\\nwas worse tangled, but his clothes had been made by a tailor.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know,\" I said to him.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve bought a cottage in the Bronx with the money,\" said he. \"Any\\nevening at 7.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" said I, \"when you led us against the lumberman--the--Klondiker\\n--it wasn\\'t altogether on account of the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of\\nNature?\"\\n\\n\"Well, not altogether,\" said Kraft, with a grin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMEMOIRS OF A YELLOW DOG\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t suppose it will knock any of you people off your perch to read\\na contribution from an animal. Mr. Kipling and a good many others\\nhave demonstrated the fact that animals can express themselves in\\nremunerative English, and no magazine goes to press nowadays without\\nan animal story in it, except the old-style monthlies that are still\\nrunning pictures of Bryan and the Mont PelÃ©e horror.\\n\\nBut you needn\\'t look for any stuck-up literature in my piece, such as\\nBearoo, the bear, and Snakoo, the snake, and Tammanoo, the tiger, talk\\nin the jungle books. A yellow dog that\\'s spent most of his life in a\\ncheap New York flat, sleeping in a corner on an old sateen underskirt\\n(the one she spilled port wine on at the Lady Longshoremen\\'s banquet),\\nmustn\\'t be expected to perform any tricks with the art of speech.\\n\\nI was born a yellow pup; date, locality, pedigree and weight unknown.\\nThe first thing I can recollect, an old woman had me in a basket\\nat Broadway and Twenty-third trying to sell me to a fat lady.\\nOld Mother Hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine\\nPomeranian-Hambletonian-Red-Irish-Cochin-China-Stoke-Pogis fox\\nterrier. The fat lady chased a V around among the samples of gros grain\\nflannelette in her shopping bag till she cornered it, and gave up. From\\nthat moment I was a pet--a mamma\\'s own wootsey squidlums. Say, gentle\\nreader, did you ever have a 200-pound woman breathing a flavour of\\nCamembert cheese and Peau d\\'Espagne pick you up and wallop her nose all\\nover you, remarking all the time in an Emma Eames tone of voice: \"Oh,\\noo\\'s um oodlum, doodlum, woodlum, toodlum, bitsy-witsy skoodlums?\"\\n\\nFrom a pedigreed yellow pup I grew up to be an anonymous yellow cur\\nlooking like a cross between an Angora cat and a box of lemons. But my\\nmistress never tumbled. She thought that the two primeval pups that Noah\\nchased into the ark were but a collateral branch of my ancestors. It\\ntook two policemen to keep her from entering me at the Madison Square\\nGarden for the Siberian bloodhound prize.\\n\\nI\\'ll tell you about that flat. The house was the ordinary thing in New\\nYork, paved with Parian marble in the entrance hall and cobblestones\\nabove the first floor. Our flat was three--well, not flights--climbs up.\\nMy mistress rented it unfurnished, and put in the regular things--1903\\nantique unholstered parlour set, oil chromo of geishas in a Harlem tea\\nhouse, rubber plant and husband.\\n\\nBy Sirius! there was a biped I felt sorry for. He was a little man with\\nsandy hair and whiskers a good deal like mine. Henpecked?--well, toucans\\nand flamingoes and pelicans all had their bills in him. He wiped the\\ndishes and listened to my mistress tell about the cheap, ragged things\\nthe lady with the squirrel-skin coat on the second floor hung out on her\\nline to dry. And every evening while she was getting supper she made him\\ntake me out on the end of a string for a walk.\\n\\nIf men knew how women pass the time when they are alone they\\'d never\\nmarry. Laura Lean Jibbey, peanut brittle, a little almond cream on the\\nneck muscles, dishes unwashed, half an hour\\'s talk with the iceman,\\nreading a package of old letters, a couple of pickles and two bottles of\\nmalt extract, one hour peeking through a hole in the window shade into\\nthe flat across the air-shaft--that\\'s about all there is to it. Twenty\\nminutes before time for him to come home from work she straightens up\\nthe house, fixes her rat so it won\\'t show, and gets out a lot of sewing\\nfor a ten-minute bluff.\\n\\nI led a dog\\'s life in that flat. \\'Most all day I lay there in my corner\\nwatching that fat woman kill time. I slept sometimes and had pipe dreams\\nabout being out chasing cats into basements and growling at old ladies\\nwith black mittens, as a dog was intended to do. Then she would pounce\\nupon me with a lot of that drivelling poodle palaver and kiss me on the\\nnose--but what could I do? A dog can\\'t chew cloves.\\n\\nI began to feel sorry for Hubby, dog my cats if I didn\\'t. We looked so\\nmuch alike that people noticed it when we went out; so we shook the\\nstreets that Morgan\\'s cab drives down, and took to climbing the piles\\nof last December\\'s snow on the streets where cheap people live.\\n\\nOne evening when we were thus promenading, and I was trying to look like\\na prize St. Bernard, and the old man was trying to look like he wouldn\\'t\\nhave murdered the first organ-grinder he heard play Mendelssohn\\'s\\nwedding-march, I looked up at him and said, in my way:\\n\\n\"What are you looking so sour about, you oakum trimmed lobster? She\\ndon\\'t kiss you. You don\\'t have to sit on her lap and listen to talk\\nthat would make the book of a musical comedy sound like the maxims of\\nEpictetus. You ought to be thankful you\\'re not a dog. Brace up,\\nBenedick, and bid the blues begone.\"\\n\\nThe matrimonial mishap looked down at me with almost canine intelligence\\nin his face.\\n\\n\"Why, doggie,\" says he, \"good doggie. You almost look like you could\\nspeak. What is it, doggie--Cats?\"\\n\\nCats! Could speak!\\n\\nBut, of course, he couldn\\'t understand. Humans were denied the speech of\\nanimals. The only common ground of communication upon which dogs and men\\ncan get together is in fiction.\\n\\nIn the flat across the hall from us lived a lady with a black-and-tan\\nterrier. Her husband strung it and took it out every evening, but he\\nalways came home cheerful and whistling. One day I touched noses with\\nthe black-and-tan in the hall, and I struck him for an elucidation.\\n\\n\"See, here, Wiggle-and-Skip,\" I says, \"you know that it ain\\'t the nature\\nof a real man to play dry nurse to a dog in public. I never saw one\\nleashed to a bow-wow yet that didn\\'t look like he\\'d like to lick every\\nother man that looked at him. But your boss comes in every day as perky\\nand set up as an amateur prestidigitator doing the egg trick. How does\\nhe do it? Don\\'t tell me he likes it.\"\\n\\n\"Him?\" says the black-and-tan. \"Why, he uses Nature\\'s Own Remedy. He\\ngets spifflicated. At first when we go out he\\'s as shy as the man on the\\nsteamer who would rather play pedro when they make \\'em all jackpots. By\\nthe time we\\'ve been in eight saloons he don\\'t care whether the thing on\\nthe end of his line is a dog or a catfish. I\\'ve lost two inches of my\\ntail trying to sidestep those swinging doors.\"\\n\\nThe pointer I got from that terrier--vaudeville please copy--set me to\\nthinking.\\n\\nOne evening about 6 o\\'clock my mistress ordered him to get busy and do\\nthe ozone act for Lovey. I have concealed it until now, but that is what\\nshe called me. The black-and-tan was called \"Tweetness.\" I consider\\nthat I have the bulge on him as far as you could chase a rabbit. Still\\n\"Lovey\" is something of a nomenclatural tin can on the tail of one\\'s\\nself respect.\\n\\nAt a quiet place on a safe street I tightened the line of my custodian\\nin front of an attractive, refined saloon. I made a dead-ahead scramble\\nfor the doors, whining like a dog in the press despatches that lets the\\nfamily know that little Alice is bogged while gathering lilies in the\\nbrook.\\n\\n\"Why, darn my eyes,\" says the old man, with a grin; \"darn my eyes if the\\nsaffron-coloured son of a seltzer lemonade ain\\'t asking me in to take\\na drink. Lemme see--how long\\'s it been since I saved shoe leather by\\nkeeping one foot on the foot-rest? I believe I\\'ll--\"\\n\\nI knew I had him. Hot Scotches he took, sitting at a table. For an hour\\nhe kept the Campbells coming. I sat by his side rapping for the waiter\\nwith my tail, and eating free lunch such as mamma in her flat never\\nequalled with her homemade truck bought at a delicatessen store eight\\nminutes before papa comes home.\\n\\nWhen the products of Scotland were all exhausted except the rye bread\\nthe old man unwound me from the table leg and played me outside like a\\nfisherman plays a salmon. Out there he took off my collar and threw it\\ninto the street.\\n\\n\"Poor doggie,\" says he; \"good doggie. She shan\\'t kiss you any more. \\'S a\\ndarned shame. Good doggie, go away and get run over by a street car and\\nbe happy.\"\\n\\nI refused to leave. I leaped and frisked around the old man\\'s legs happy\\nas a pug on a rug.\\n\\n\"You old flea-headed woodchuck-chaser,\" I said to him--\"you moon-baying,\\nrabbit-pointing, egg-stealing old beagle, can\\'t you see that I don\\'t\\nwant to leave you? Can\\'t you see that we\\'re both Pups in the Wood and\\nthe missis is the cruel uncle after you with the dish towel and me with\\nthe flea liniment and a pink bow to tie on my tail. Why not cut that all\\nout and be pards forever more?\"\\n\\nMaybe you\\'ll say he didn\\'t understand--maybe he didn\\'t. But he kind of\\ngot a grip on the Hot Scotches, and stood still for a minute, thinking.\\n\\n\"Doggie,\" says he, finally, \"we don\\'t live more than a dozen lives on\\nthis earth, and very few of us live to be more than 300. If I ever see\\nthat flat any more I\\'m a flat, and if you do you\\'re flatter; and that\\'s\\nno flattery. I\\'m offering 60 to 1 that Westward Ho wins out by the\\nlength of a dachshund.\"\\n\\nThere was no string, but I frolicked along with my master to the\\nTwenty-third street ferry. And the cats on the route saw reason to give\\nthanks that prehensile claws had been given them.\\n\\nOn the Jersey side my master said to a stranger who stood eating a\\ncurrant bun:\\n\\n\"Me and my doggie, we are bound for the Rocky Mountains.\"\\n\\nBut what pleased me most was when my old man pulled both of my ears\\nuntil I howled, and said:\\n\\n\"You common, monkey-headed, rat-tailed, sulphur-coloured son of a door\\nmat, do you know what I\\'m going to call you?\"\\n\\nI thought of \"Lovey,\" and I whined dolefully.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to call you \\'Pete,\\'\" says my master; and if I\\'d had five\\ntails I couldn\\'t have done enough wagging to do justice to the occasion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LOVE-PHILTRE OF IKEY SCHOENSTEIN\\n\\nThe Blue Light Drug Store is downtown, between the Bowery and First\\nAvenue, where the distance between the two streets is the shortest. The\\nBlue Light does not consider that pharmacy is a thing of bric-a-brac,\\nscent and ice-cream soda. If you ask it for pain-killer it will not\\ngive you a bonbon.\\n\\nThe Blue Light scorns the labour-saving arts of modern pharmacy. It\\nmacerates its opium and percolates its own laudanum and paregoric.\\nTo this day pills are made behind its tall prescription desk--pills\\nrolled out on its own pill-tile, divided with a spatula, rolled with\\nthe finger and thumb, dusted with calcined magnesia and delivered in\\nlittle round pasteboard pill-boxes. The store is on a corner about\\nwhich coveys of ragged-plumed, hilarious children play and become\\ncandidates for the cough drops and soothing syrups that wait for them\\ninside.\\n\\nIkey Schoenstein was the night clerk of the Blue Light and the friend of\\nhis customers. Thus it is on the East Side, where the heart of pharmacy\\nis not glacÃ©. There, as it should be, the druggist is a counsellor, a\\nconfessor, an adviser, an able and willing missionary and mentor whose\\nlearning is respected, whose occult wisdom is venerated and whose\\nmedicine is often poured, untasted, into the gutter. Therefore Ikey\\'s\\ncorniform, be-spectacled nose and narrow, knowledge-bowed figure was\\nwell known in the vicinity of the Blue Light, and his advice and notice\\nwere much desired.\\n\\nIkey roomed and breakfasted at Mrs. Riddle\\'s two squares away. Mrs.\\nRiddle had a daughter named Rosy. The circumlocution has been in\\nvain--you must have guessed it--Ikey adored Rosy. She tinctured all\\nhis thoughts; she was the compound extract of all that was chemically\\npure and officinal--the dispensatory contained nothing equal to her.\\nBut Ikey was timid, and his hopes remained insoluble in the menstruum\\nof his backwardness and fears. Behind his counter he was a superior\\nbeing, calmly conscious of special knowledge and worth; outside he\\nwas a weak-kneed, purblind, motorman-cursed rambler, with ill-fitting\\nclothes stained with chemicals and smelling of socotrine aloes and\\nvalerianate of ammonia.\\n\\nThe fly in Ikey\\'s ointment (thrice welcome, pat trope!) was Chunk\\nMcGowan.\\n\\nMr. McGowan was also striving to catch the bright smiles tossed about by\\nRosy. But he was no outfielder as Ikey was; he picked them off the bat.\\nAt the same time he was Ikey\\'s friend and customer, and often dropped in\\nat the Blue Light Drug Store to have a bruise painted with iodine or get\\na cut rubber-plastered after a pleasant evening spent along the Bowery.\\n\\nOne afternoon McGowan drifted in in his silent, easy way, and sat,\\ncomely, smooth-faced, hard, indomitable, good-natured, upon a stool.\\n\\n\"Ikey,\" said he, when his friend had fetched his mortar and sat\\nopposite, grinding gum benzoin to a powder, \"get busy with your ear.\\nIt\\'s drugs for me if you\\'ve got the line I need.\"\\n\\nIkey scanned the countenance of Mr. McGowan for the usual evidences of\\nconflict, but found none.\\n\\n\"Take your coat off,\" he ordered. \"I guess already that you have been\\nstuck in the ribs with a knife. I have many times told you those Dagoes\\nwould do you up.\"\\n\\nMr. McGowan smiled. \"Not them,\" he said. \"Not any Dagoes. But you\\'ve\\nlocated the diagnosis all right enough--it\\'s under my coat, near the\\nribs. Say! Ikey--Rosy and me are goin\\' to run away and get married\\nto-night.\"\\n\\nIkey\\'s left forefinger was doubled over the edge of the mortar, holding\\nit steady. He gave it a wild rap with the pestle, but felt it not.\\nMeanwhile Mr. McGowan\\'s smile faded to a look of perplexed gloom.\\n\\n\"That is,\" he continued, \"if she keeps in the notion until the time\\ncomes. We\\'ve been layin\\' pipes for the getaway for two weeks. One day\\nshe says she will; the same evenin\\' she says nixy. We\\'ve agreed on\\nto-night, and Rosy\\'s stuck to the affirmative this time for two whole\\ndays. But it\\'s five hours yet till the time, and I\\'m afraid she\\'ll\\nstand me up when it comes to the scratch.\"\\n\\n\"You said you wanted drugs,\" remarked Ikey.\\n\\nMr. McGowan looked ill at ease and harassed--a condition opposed to his\\nusual line of demeanour. He made a patent-medicine almanac into a roll\\nand fitted it with unprofitable carefulness about his finger.\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t have this double handicap make a false start to-night for a\\nmillion,\" he said. \"I\\'ve got a little flat up in Harlem all ready, with\\nchrysanthemums on the table and a kettle ready to boil. And I\\'ve engaged\\na pulpit pounder to be ready at his house for us at 9.30. It\\'s got to\\ncome off. And if Rosy don\\'t change her mind again!\"--Mr. McGowan ceased,\\na prey to his doubts.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see then yet,\" said Ikey, shortly, \"what makes it that you talk\\nof drugs, or what I can be doing about it.\"\\n\\n\"Old man Riddle don\\'t like me a little bit,\" went on the uneasy suitor,\\nbent upon marshalling his arguments. \"For a week he hasn\\'t let Rosy step\\noutside the door with me. If it wasn\\'t for losin\\' a boarder they\\'d have\\nbounced me long ago. I\\'m makin\\' $20 a week and she\\'ll never regret\\nflyin\\' the coop with Chunk McGowan.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse me, Chunk,\" said Ikey. \"I must make a prescription that\\nis to be called for soon.\"\\n\\n\"Say,\" said McGowan, looking up suddenly, \"say, Ikey, ain\\'t there a drug\\nof some kind--some kind of powders that\\'ll make a girl like you better\\nif you give \\'em to her?\"\\n\\nIkey\\'s lip beneath his nose curled with the scorn of superior\\nenlightenment; but before he could answer, McGowan continued:\\n\\n\"Tim Lacy told me he got some once from a croaker uptown and fed \\'em to\\nhis girl in soda water. From the very first dose he was ace-high and\\neverybody else looked like thirty cents to her. They was married in less\\nthan two weeks.\"\\n\\nStrong and simple was Chunk McGowan. A better reader of men than Ikey\\nwas could have seen that his tough frame was strung upon fine wires.\\nLike a good general who was about to invade the enemy\\'s territory he\\nwas seeking to guard every point against possible failure.\\n\\n\"I thought,\" went on Chunk hopefully, \"that if I had one of them powders\\nto give Rosy when I see her at supper to-night it might brace her up and\\nkeep her from reneging on the proposition to skip. I guess she don\\'t\\nneed a mule team to drag her away, but women are better at coaching than\\nthey are at running bases. If the stuff\\'ll work just for a couple of\\nhours it\\'ll do the trick.\"\\n\\n\"When is this foolishness of running away to be happening?\" asked Ikey.\\n\\n\"Nine o\\'clock,\" said Mr. McGowan. \"Supper\\'s at seven. At eight Rosy goes\\nto bed with a headache. At nine old Parvenzano lets me through to his\\nback yard, where there\\'s a board off Riddle\\'s fence, next door. I go\\nunder her window and help her down the fire-escape. We\\'ve got to make it\\nearly on the preacher\\'s account. It\\'s all dead easy if Rosy don\\'t balk\\nwhen the flag drops. Can you fix me one of them powders, Ikey?\"\\n\\nIkey Schoenstein rubbed his nose slowly.\\n\\n\"Chunk,\" said he, \"it is of drugs of that nature that pharmaceutists\\nmust have much carefulness. To you alone of my acquaintance would I\\nintrust a powder like that. But for you I shall make it, and you shall\\nsee how it makes Rosy to think of you.\"\\n\\nIkey went behind the prescription desk. There he crushed to a powder two\\nsoluble tablets, each containing a quarter of a grain of morphia. To\\nthem he added a little sugar of milk to increase the bulk, and folded\\nthe mixture neatly in a white paper. Taken by an adult this powder would\\ninsure several hours of heavy slumber without danger to the sleeper.\\nThis he handed to Chunk McGowan, telling him to administer it in a\\nliquid if possible, and received the hearty thanks of the backyard\\nLochinvar.\\n\\nThe subtlety of Ikey\\'s action becomes apparent upon recital of his\\nsubsequent move. He sent a messenger for Mr. Riddle and disclosed the\\nplans of Mr. McGowan for eloping with Rosy. Mr. Riddle was a stout man,\\nbrick-dusty of complexion and sudden in action.\\n\\n\"Much obliged,\" he said, briefly, to Ikey. \"The lazy Irish loafer! My\\nown room\\'s just above Rosy\\'s. I\\'ll just go up there myself after supper\\nand load the shot-gun and wait. If he comes in my back yard he\\'ll go\\naway in a ambulance instead of a bridal chaise.\"\\n\\nWith Rosy held in the clutches of Morpheus for a many-hours deep\\nslumber, and the bloodthirsty parent waiting, armed and forewarned,\\nIkey felt that his rival was close, indeed, upon discomfiture.\\n\\nAll night in the Blue Light Drug Store he waited at his duties for\\nchance news of the tragedy, but none came.\\n\\nAt eight o\\'clock in the morning the day clerk arrived and Ikey started\\nhurriedly for Mrs. Riddle\\'s to learn the outcome. And, lo! as he stepped\\nout of the store who but Chunk McGowan sprang from a passing street car\\nand grasped his hand--Chunk McGowan with a victor\\'s smile and flushed\\nwith joy.\\n\\n\"Pulled it off,\" said Chunk with Elysium in his grin. \"Rosy hit the\\nfire-escape on time to a second, and we was under the wire at the\\nReverend\\'s at 9.3O 1/4. She\\'s up at the flat--she cooked eggs this\\nmornin\\' in a blue kimono--Lord! how lucky I am! You must pace up some\\nday, Ikey, and feed with us. I\\'ve got a job down near the bridge, and\\nthat\\'s where I\\'m heading for now.\"\\n\\n\"The--the--powder?\" stammered Ikey.\\n\\n\"Oh, that stuff you gave me!\" said Chunk, broadening his grin; \"well, it\\nwas this way. I sat down at the supper table last night at Riddle\\'s, and\\nI looked at Rosy, and I says to myself, \\'Chunk, if you get the girl get\\nher on the square--don\\'t try any hocus-pocus with a thoroughbred like\\nher.\\' And I keeps the paper you give me in my pocket. And then my lamps\\nfall on another party present, who, I says to myself, is failin\\' in a\\nproper affection toward his comin\\' son-in-law, so I watches my chance\\nand dumps that powder in old man Riddle\\'s coffee--see?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMAMMON AND THE ARCHER\\n\\n\\nOld Anthony Rockwall, retired manufacturer and proprietor of Rockwall\\'s\\nEureka Soap, looked out the library window of his Fifth Avenue mansion\\nand grinned. His neighbour to the right--the aristocratic clubman,\\nG. Van Schuylight Suffolk-Jones--came out to his waiting motor-car,\\nwrinkling a contumelious nostril, as usual, at the Italian renaissance\\nsculpture of the soap palace\\'s front elevation.\\n\\n\"Stuck-up old statuette of nothing doing!\" commented the ex-Soap King.\\n\"The Eden Musee\\'ll get that old frozen Nesselrode yet if he don\\'t watch\\nout. I\\'ll have this house painted red, white, and blue next summer and\\nsee if that\\'ll make his Dutch nose turn up any higher.\"\\n\\nAnd then Anthony Rockwall, who never cared for bells, went to the door\\nof his library and shouted \"Mike!\" in the same voice that had once\\nchipped off pieces of the welkin on the Kansas prairies.\\n\\n\"Tell my son,\" said Anthony to the answering menial, \"to come in here\\nbefore he leaves the house.\"\\n\\nWhen young Rockwall entered the library the old man laid aside his\\nnewspaper, looked at him with a kindly grimness on his big, smooth,\\nruddy countenance, rumpled his mop of white hair with one hand and\\nrattled the keys in his pocket with the other.\\n\\n\"Richard,\" said Anthony Rockwall, \"what do you pay for the soap that\\nyou use?\"\\n\\nRichard, only six months home from college, was startled a little. He\\nhad not yet taken the measure of this sire of his, who was as full of\\nunexpectednesses as a girl at her first party.\\n\\n\"Six dollars a dozen, I think, dad.\"\\n\\n\"And your clothes?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose about sixty dollars, as a rule.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re a gentleman,\" said Anthony, decidedly. \"I\\'ve heard of these\\nyoung bloods spending $24 a dozen for soap, and going over the hundred\\nmark for clothes. You\\'ve got as much money to waste as any of \\'em,\\nand yet you stick to what\\'s decent and moderate. Now I use the old\\nEureka--not only for sentiment, but it\\'s the purest soap made. Whenever\\nyou pay more than 10 cents a cake for soap you buy bad perfumes and\\nlabels. But 50 cents is doing very well for a young man in your\\ngeneration, position and condition. As I said, you\\'re a gentleman. They\\nsay it takes three generations to make one. They\\'re off. Money\\'ll do it\\nas slick as soap grease. It\\'s made you one. By hokey! it\\'s almost made\\none of me. I\\'m nearly as impolite and disagreeable and ill-mannered as\\nthese two old Knickerbocker gents on each side of me that can\\'t sleep of\\nnights because I bought in between \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"There are some things that money can\\'t accomplish,\" remarked young\\nRockwall, rather gloomily.\\n\\n\"Now, don\\'t say that,\" said old Anthony, shocked. \"I bet my money on\\nmoney every time. I\\'ve been through the encyclopaedia down to Y looking\\nfor something you can\\'t buy with it; and I expect to have to take up the\\nappendix next week. I\\'m for money against the field. Tell me something\\nmoney won\\'t buy.\"\\n\\n\"For one thing,\" answered Richard, rankling a little, \"it won\\'t buy one\\ninto the exclusive circles of society.\"\\n\\n\"Oho! won\\'t it?\" thundered the champion of the root of evil. \"You tell\\nme where your exclusive circles would be if the first Astor hadn\\'t had\\nthe money to pay for his steerage passage over?\"\\n\\nRichard sighed.\\n\\n\"And that\\'s what I was coming to,\" said the old man, less boisterously.\\n\"That\\'s why I asked you to come in. There\\'s something going wrong with\\nyou, boy. I\\'ve been noticing it for two weeks. Out with it. I guess I\\ncould lay my hands on eleven millions within twenty-four hours, besides\\nthe real estate. If it\\'s your liver, there\\'s the _Rambler_ down in the\\nbay, coaled, and ready to steam down to the Bahamas in two days.\"\\n\\n\"Not a bad guess, dad; you haven\\'t missed it far.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Anthony, keenly; \"what\\'s her name?\"\\n\\nRichard began to walk up and down the library floor. There was enough\\ncomradeship and sympathy in this crude old father of his to draw his\\nconfidence.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you ask her?\" demanded old Anthony. \"She\\'ll jump at you.\\nYou\\'ve got the money and the looks, and you\\'re a decent boy. Your hands\\nare clean. You\\'ve got no Eureka soap on \\'em. You\\'ve been to college, but\\nshe\\'ll overlook that.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t had a chance,\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Make one,\" said Anthony. \"Take her for a walk in the park, or a straw\\nride, or walk home with her from church. Chance! Pshaw!\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know the social mill, dad. She\\'s part of the stream that\\nturns it. Every hour and minute of her time is arranged for days in\\nadvance. I must have that girl, dad, or this town is a blackjack swamp\\nforevermore. And I can\\'t write it--I can\\'t do that.\"\\n\\n\"Tut!\" said the old man. \"Do you mean to tell me that with all the money\\nI\\'ve got you can\\'t get an hour or two of a girl\\'s time for yourself?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve put it off too late. She\\'s going to sail for Europe at noon day\\nafter to-morrow for a two years\\' stay. I\\'m to see her alone to-morrow\\nevening for a few minutes. She\\'s at Larchmont now at her aunt\\'s. I can\\'t\\ngo there. But I\\'m allowed to meet her with a cab at the Grand Central\\nStation to-morrow evening at the 8.30 train. We drive down Broadway to\\nWallack\\'s at a gallop, where her mother and a box party will be waiting\\nfor us in the lobby. Do you think she would listen to a declaration from\\nme during that six or eight minutes under those circumstances? No. And\\nwhat chance would I have in the theatre or afterward? None. No, dad,\\nthis is one tangle that your money can\\'t unravel. We can\\'t buy one\\nminute of time with cash; if we could, rich people would live longer.\\nThere\\'s no hope of getting a talk with Miss Lantry before she sails.\"\\n\\n\"All right, Richard, my boy,\" said old Anthony, cheerfully. \"You may run\\nalong down to your club now. I\\'m glad it ain\\'t your liver. But don\\'t\\nforget to burn a few punk sticks in the joss house to the great god\\nMazuma from time to time. You say money won\\'t buy time? Well, of course,\\nyou can\\'t order eternity wrapped up and delivered at your residence for\\na price, but I\\'ve seen Father Time get pretty bad stone bruises on his\\nheels when he walked through the gold diggings.\"\\n\\nThat night came Aunt Ellen, gentle, sentimental, wrinkled, sighing,\\noppressed by wealth, in to Brother Anthony at his evening paper, and\\nbegan discourse on the subject of lovers\\' woes.\\n\\n\"He told me all about it,\" said brother Anthony, yawning. \"I told him my\\nbank account was at his service. And then he began to knock money. Said\\nmoney couldn\\'t help. Said the rules of society couldn\\'t be bucked for a\\nyard by a team of ten-millionaires.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Anthony,\" sighed Aunt Ellen, \"I wish you would not think so much of\\nmoney. Wealth is nothing where a true affection is concerned. Love is\\nall-powerful. If he only had spoken earlier! She could not have refused\\nour Richard. But now I fear it is too late. He will have no opportunity\\nto address her. All your gold cannot bring happiness to your son.\"\\n\\nAt eight o\\'clock the next evening Aunt Ellen took a quaint old gold ring\\nfrom a moth-eaten case and gave it to Richard.\\n\\n\"Wear it to-night, nephew,\" she begged. \"Your mother gave it to me. Good\\nluck in love she said it brought. She asked me to give it to you when\\nyou had found the one you loved.\"\\n\\nYoung Rockwall took the ring reverently and tried it on his smallest\\nfinger. It slipped as far as the second joint and stopped. He took it\\noff and stuffed it into his vest pocket, after the manner of man. And\\nthen he \\'phoned for his cab.\\n\\nAt the station he captured Miss Lantry out of the gadding mob at eight\\nthirty-two.\\n\\n\"We mustn\\'t keep mamma and the others waiting,\" said she.\\n\\n\"To Wallack\\'s Theatre as fast as you can drive!\" said Richard loyally.\\n\\nThey whirled up Forty-second to Broadway, and then down the\\nwhite-starred lane that leads from the soft meadows of sunset to the\\nrocky hills of morning.\\n\\nAt Thirty-fourth Street young Richard quickly thrust up the trap and\\nordered the cabman to stop.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve dropped a ring,\" he apologised, as he climbed out. \"It was my\\nmother\\'s, and I\\'d hate to lose it. I won\\'t detain you a minute--I saw\\nwhere it fell.\"\\n\\nIn less than a minute he was back in the cab with the ring.\\n\\nBut within that minute a crosstown car had stopped directly in front of\\nthe cab. The cabman tried to pass to the left, but a heavy express wagon\\ncut him off. He tried the right, and had to back away from a furniture\\nvan that had no business to be there. He tried to back out, but dropped\\nhis reins and swore dutifully. He was blockaded in a tangled mess of\\nvehicles and horses.\\n\\nOne of those street blockades had occurred that sometimes tie up\\ncommerce and movement quite suddenly in the big city.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you drive on?\" said Miss Lantry, impatiently. \"We\\'ll be\\nlate.\"\\n\\nRichard stood up in the cab and looked around. He saw a congested flood\\nof wagons, trucks, cabs, vans and street cars filling the vast space\\nwhere Broadway, Sixth Avenue and Thirty-fourth street cross one another\\nas a twenty-six inch maiden fills her twenty-two inch girdle. And still\\nfrom all the cross streets they were hurrying and rattling toward\\nthe converging point at full speed, and hurling themselves into the\\nstruggling mass, locking wheels and adding their drivers\\' imprecations\\nto the clamour. The entire traffic of Manhattan seemed to have jammed\\nitself around them. The oldest New Yorker among the thousands of\\nspectators that lined the sidewalks had not witnessed a street blockade\\nof the proportions of this one.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very sorry,\" said Richard, as he resumed his seat, \"but it looks as\\nif we are stuck. They won\\'t get this jumble loosened up in an hour. It\\nwas my fault. If I hadn\\'t dropped the ring we--\"\\n\\n\"Let me see the ring,\" said Miss Lantry. \"Now that it can\\'t be helped,\\nI don\\'t care. I think theatres are stupid, anyway.\"\\n\\nAt 11 o\\'clock that night somebody tapped lightly on Anthony Rockwall\\'s\\ndoor.\\n\\n\"Come in,\" shouted Anthony, who was in a red dressing-gown, reading a\\nbook of piratical adventures.\\n\\nSomebody was Aunt Ellen, looking like a grey-haired angel that had been\\nleft on earth by mistake.\\n\\n\"They\\'re engaged, Anthony,\" she said, softly. \"She has promised to marry\\nour Richard. On their way to the theatre there was a street blockade,\\nand it was two hours before their cab could get out of it.\\n\\n\"And oh, brother Anthony, don\\'t ever boast of the power of money again.\\nA little emblem of true love--a little ring that symbolised unending\\nand unmercenary affection--was the cause of our Richard finding his\\nhappiness. He dropped it in the street, and got out to recover it. And\\nbefore they could continue the blockade occurred. He spoke to his love\\nand won her there while the cab was hemmed in. Money is dross compared\\nwith true love, Anthony.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said old Anthony. \"I\\'m glad the boy has got what he wanted.\\nI told him I wouldn\\'t spare any expense in the matter if--\"\\n\\n\"But, brother Anthony, what good could your money have done?\"\\n\\n\"Sister,\" said Anthony Rockwall. \"I\\'ve got my pirate in a devil of a\\nscrape. His ship has just been scuttled, and he\\'s too good a judge of\\nthe value of money to let drown. I wish you would let me go on with\\nthis chapter.\"\\n\\nThe story should end here. I wish it would as heartily as you who read\\nit wish it did. But we must go to the bottom of the well for truth.\\n\\nThe next day a person with red hands and a blue polka-dot necktie, who\\ncalled himself Kelly, called at Anthony Rockwall\\'s house, and was at\\nonce received in the library.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Anthony, reaching for his chequebook, \"it was a good bilin\\'\\nof soap. Let\\'s see--you had $5,000 in cash.\"\\n\\n\"I paid out $300 more of my own,\" said Kelly. \"I had to go a little\\nabove the estimate. I got the express wagons and cabs mostly for $5; but\\nthe trucks and two-horse teams mostly raised me to $10. The motormen\\nwanted $10, and some of the loaded teams $20. The cops struck me\\nhardest--$50 I paid two, and the rest $20 and $25. But didn\\'t it work\\nbeautiful, Mr. Rockwall? I\\'m glad William A. Brady wasn\\'t onto that\\nlittle outdoor vehicle mob scene. I wouldn\\'t want William to break his\\nheart with jealousy. And never a rehearsal, either! The boys was on time\\nto the fraction of a second. It was two hours before a snake could get\\nbelow Greeley\\'s statue.\"\\n\\n\"Thirteen hundred--there you are, Kelly,\" said Anthony, tearing off a\\ncheck. \"Your thousand, and the $300 you were out. You don\\'t despise\\nmoney, do you, Kelly?\"\\n\\n\"Me?\" said Kelly. \"I can lick the man that invented poverty.\"\\n\\nAnthony called Kelly when he was at the door.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t notice,\" said he, \"anywhere in the tie-up, a kind of a fat\\nboy without any clothes on shooting arrows around with a bow, did you?\"\\n\\n\"Why, no,\" said Kelly, mystified. \"I didn\\'t. If he was like you say,\\nmaybe the cops pinched him before I got there.\"\\n\\n\"I thought the little rascal wouldn\\'t be on hand,\" chuckled Anthony.\\n\"Good-by, Kelly.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSPRINGTIME Ã€ LA CARTE\\n\\n\\nIt was a day in March.\\n\\nNever, never begin a story this way when you write one. No opening could\\npossibly be worse. It is unimaginative, flat, dry and likely to consist\\nof mere wind. But in this instance it is allowable. For the following\\nparagraph, which should have inaugurated the narrative, is too wildly\\nextravagant and preposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader\\nwithout preparation.\\n\\nSarah was crying over her bill of fare.\\n\\nThink of a New York girl shedding tears on the menu card!\\n\\nTo account for this you will be allowed to guess that the lobsters were\\nall out, or that she had sworn ice-cream off during Lent, or that she\\nhad ordered onions, or that she had just come from a Hackett matinee.\\nAnd then, all these theories being wrong, you will please let the story\\nproceed.\\n\\nThe gentleman who announced that the world was an oyster which he with\\nhis sword would open made a larger hit than he deserved. It is not\\ndifficult to open an oyster with a sword. But did you ever notice any\\none try to open the terrestrial bivalve with a typewriter? Like to wait\\nfor a dozen raw opened that way?\\n\\nSarah had managed to pry apart the shells with her unhandy weapon far\\nenough to nibble a wee bit at the cold and clammy world within. She knew\\nno more shorthand than if she had been a graduate in stenography just\\nlet slip upon the world by a business college. So, not being able to\\nstenog, she could not enter that bright galaxy of office talent. She was\\na free-lance typewriter and canvassed for odd jobs of copying.\\n\\nThe most brilliant and crowning feat of Sarah\\'s battle with the world\\nwas the deal she made with Schulenberg\\'s Home Restaurant. The restaurant\\nwas next door to the old red brick in which she ball-roomed. One\\nevening after dining at Schulenberg\\'s 40-cent, five-course _table\\nd\\'hÃ´te_ (served as fast as you throw the five baseballs at the coloured\\ngentleman\\'s head) Sarah took away with her the bill of fare. It was\\nwritten in an almost unreadable script neither English nor German, and\\nso arranged that if you were not careful you began with a toothpick and\\nrice pudding and ended with soup and the day of the week.\\n\\nThe next day Sarah showed Schulenberg a neat card on which the menu was\\nbeautifully typewritten with the viands temptingly marshalled under\\ntheir right and proper heads from \"hors d\\'oeuvre\" to \"not responsible\\nfor overcoats and umbrellas.\"\\n\\nSchulenberg became a naturalised citizen on the spot. Before Sarah left\\nhim she had him willingly committed to an agreement. She was to furnish\\ntypewritten bills of fare for the twenty-one tables in the restaurant--a\\nnew bill for each day\\'s dinner, and new ones for breakfast and lunch as\\noften as changes occurred in the food or as neatness required.\\n\\nIn return for this Schulenberg was to send three meals per diem to\\nSarah\\'s hall room by a waiter--an obsequious one if possible--and\\nfurnish her each afternoon with a pencil draft of what Fate had in\\nstore for Schulenberg\\'s customers on the morrow.\\n\\nMutual satisfaction resulted from the agreement. Schulenberg\\'s patrons\\nnow knew what the food they ate was called even if its nature sometimes\\npuzzled them. And Sarah had food during a cold, dull winter, which was\\nthe main thing with her.\\n\\nAnd then the almanac lied, and said that spring had come. Spring comes\\nwhen it comes. The frozen snows of January still lay like adamant in\\nthe crosstown streets. The hand-organs still played \"In the Good Old\\nSummertime,\" with their December vivacity and expression. Men began to\\nmake thirty-day notes to buy Easter dresses. Janitors shut off steam.\\nAnd when these things happen one may know that the city is still in the\\nclutches of winter.\\n\\nOne afternoon Sarah shivered in her elegant hall bedroom; \"house heated;\\nscrupulously clean; conveniences; seen to be appreciated.\" She had no\\nwork to do except Schulenberg\\'s menu cards. Sarah sat in her squeaky\\nwillow rocker, and looked out the window. The calendar on the wall kept\\ncrying to her: \"Springtime is here, Sarah--springtime is here, I tell\\nyou. Look at me, Sarah, my figures show it. You\\'ve got a neat figure\\nyourself, Sarah--a--nice springtime figure--why do you look out the\\nwindow so sadly?\"\\n\\nSarah\\'s room was at the back of the house. Looking out the window she\\ncould see the windowless rear brick wall of the box factory on the next\\nstreet. But the wall was clearest crystal; and Sarah was looking down a\\ngrassy lane shaded with cherry trees and elms and bordered with\\nraspberry bushes and Cherokee roses.\\n\\nSpring\\'s real harbingers are too subtle for the eye and ear. Some must\\nhave the flowering crocus, the wood-starring dogwood, the voice of\\nbluebird--even so gross a reminder as the farewell handshake of the\\nretiring buckwheat and oyster before they can welcome the Lady in\\nGreen to their dull bosoms. But to old earth\\'s choicest kin there come\\nstraight, sweet messages from his newest bride, telling them they shall\\nbe no stepchildren unless they choose to be.\\n\\nOn the previous summer Sarah had gone into the country and loved a\\nfarmer.\\n\\n(In writing your story never hark back thus. It is bad art, and cripples\\ninterest. Let it march, march.)\\n\\nSarah stayed two weeks at Sunnybrook Farm. There she learned to love old\\nFarmer Franklin\\'s son Walter. Farmers have been loved and wedded and\\nturned out to grass in less time. But young Walter Franklin was a modern\\nagriculturist. He had a telephone in his cow house, and he could figure\\nup exactly what effect next year\\'s Canada wheat crop would have on\\npotatoes planted in the dark of the moon.\\n\\nIt was in this shaded and raspberried lane that Walter had wooed and won\\nher. And together they had sat and woven a crown of dandelions for her\\nhair. He had immoderately praised the effect of the yellow blossoms\\nagainst her brown tresses; and she had left the chaplet there, and\\nwalked back to the house swinging her straw sailor in her hands.\\n\\nThey were to marry in the spring--at the very first signs of spring,\\nWalter said. And Sarah came back to the city to pound her typewriter.\\n\\nA knock at the door dispelled Sarah\\'s visions of that happy day. A\\nwaiter had brought the rough pencil draft of the Home Restaurant\\'s next\\nday fare in old Schulenberg\\'s angular hand.\\n\\nSarah sat down to her typewriter and slipped a card between the rollers.\\nShe was a nimble worker. Generally in an hour and a half the twenty-one\\nmenu cards were written and ready.\\n\\nTo-day there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual. The soups\\nwere lighter; pork was eliminated from the entrÃ©es, figuring only with\\nRussian turnips among the roasts. The gracious spirit of spring pervaded\\nthe entire menu. Lamb, that lately capered on the greening hillsides,\\nwas becoming exploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols. The\\nsong of the oyster, though not silenced, was _dimuendo con amore_. The\\nfrying-pan seemed to be held, inactive, behind the beneficent bars of\\nthe broiler. The pie list swelled; the richer puddings had vanished;\\nthe sausage, with his drapery wrapped about him, barely lingered in a\\npleasant thanatopsis with the buckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple.\\n\\nSarah\\'s fingers danced like midgets above a summer stream. Down through\\nthe courses she worked, giving each item its position according to its\\nlength with an accurate eye. Just above the desserts came the list of\\nvegetables. Carrots and peas, asparagus on toast, the perennial tomatoes\\nand corn and succotash, lima beans, cabbage--and then--\\n\\nSarah was crying over her bill of fare. Tears from the depths of some\\ndivine despair rose in her heart and gathered to her eyes. Down went her\\nhead on the little typewriter stand; and the keyboard rattled a dry\\naccompaniment to her moist sobs.\\n\\nFor she had received no letter from Walter in two weeks, and the next\\nitem on the bill of fare was dandelions--dandelions with some kind of\\negg--but bother the egg!--dandelions, with whose golden blooms Walter\\nhad crowned her his queen of love and future bride--dandelions, the\\nharbingers of spring, her sorrow\\'s crown of sorrow--reminder of her\\nhappiest days.\\n\\nMadam, I dare you to smile until you suffer this test: Let the Marechal\\nNiel roses that Percy brought you on the night you gave him your\\nheart be served as a salad with French dressing before your eyes\\nat a Schulenberg _table d\\'hÃ´te_. Had Juliet so seen her love tokens\\ndishonoured the sooner would she have sought the lethean herbs of the\\ngood apothecary.\\n\\nBut what a witch is Spring! Into the great cold city of stone and iron a\\nmessage had to be sent. There was none to convey it but the little hardy\\ncourier of the fields with his rough green coat and modest air. He is a\\ntrue soldier of fortune, this _dent-de-lion_--this lion\\'s tooth, as the\\nFrench chefs call him. Flowered, he will assist at love-making, wreathed\\nin my lady\\'s nut-brown hair; young and callow and unblossomed, he goes\\ninto the boiling pot and delivers the word of his sovereign mistress.\\n\\nBy and by Sarah forced back her tears. The cards must be written. But,\\nstill in a faint, golden glow from her dandeleonine dream, she fingered\\nthe typewriter keys absently for a little while, with her mind and heart\\nin the meadow lane with her young farmer. But soon she came swiftly back\\nto the rock-bound lanes of Manhattan, and the typewriter began to rattle\\nand jump like a strike-breaker\\'s motor car.\\n\\nAt 6 o\\'clock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the\\ntypewritten bill of fare. When Sarah ate she set aside, with a sigh,\\nthe dish of dandelions with its crowning ovarious accompaniment. As this\\ndark mass had been transformed from a bright and love-indorsed flower\\nto be an ignominious vegetable, so had her summer hopes wilted and\\nperished. Love may, as Shakespeare said, feed on itself: but Sarah could\\nnot bring herself to eat the dandelions that had graced, as ornaments,\\nthe first spiritual banquet of her heart\\'s true affection.\\n\\nAt 7:30 the couple in the next room began to quarrel: the man in the\\nroom above sought for A on his flute; the gas went a little lower; three\\ncoal wagons started to unload--the only sound of which the phonograph is\\njealous; cats on the back fences slowly retreated toward Mukden. By\\nthese signs Sarah knew that it was time for her to read. She got out\\n\"The Cloister and the Hearth,\" the best non-selling book of the month,\\nsettled her feet on her trunk, and began to wander with Gerard.\\n\\nThe front door bell rang. The landlady answered it. Sarah left Gerard\\nand Denys treed by a bear and listened. Oh, yes; you would, just as she\\ndid!\\n\\nAnd then a strong voice was heard in the hall below, and Sarah jumped\\nfor her door, leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily\\nthe bear\\'s. You have guessed it. She reached the top of the stairs just\\nas her farmer came up, three at a jump, and reaped and garnered her,\\nwith nothing left for the gleaners.\\n\\n\"Why haven\\'t you written--oh, why?\" cried Sarah.\\n\\n\"New York is a pretty large town,\" said Walter Franklin. \"I came in a\\nweek ago to your old address. I found that you went away on a Thursday.\\nThat consoled some; it eliminated the possible Friday bad luck. But it\\ndidn\\'t prevent my hunting for you with police and otherwise ever since!\\n\\n\"I wrote!\" said Sarah, vehemently.\\n\\n\"Never got it!\"\\n\\n\"Then how did you find me?\"\\n\\nThe young farmer smiled a springtime smile.\\n\\n\"I dropped into that Home Restaurant next door this evening,\" said he.\\n\"I don\\'t care who knows it; I like a dish of some kind of greens at this\\ntime of the year. I ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare\\nlooking for something in that line. When I got below cabbage I turned my\\nchair over and hollered for the proprietor. He told me where you lived.\"\\n\\n\"I remember,\" sighed Sarah, happily. \"That was dandelions below\\ncabbage.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d know that cranky capital W \\'way above the line that your typewriter\\nmakes anywhere in the world,\" said Franklin.\\n\\n\"Why, there\\'s no W in dandelions,\" said Sarah, in surprise.\\n\\nThe young man drew the bill of fare from his pocket, and pointed to a\\nline.\\n\\nSarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon.\\nThere was still the rayed splotch in the upper right-hand corner where a\\ntear had fallen. But over the spot where one should have read the name\\nof the meadow plant, the clinging memory of their golden blossoms had\\nallowed her fingers to strike strange keys.\\n\\nBetween the red cabbage and the stuffed green peppers was the item:\\n\\n\"DEAREST WALTER, WITH HARD-BOILED EGG.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GREEN DOOR\\n\\n\\nSuppose you should be walking down Broadway after dinner, with ten\\nminutes allotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are\\nchoosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way\\nof vaudeville. Suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm. You turn to look\\ninto the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman, wonderful in diamonds and\\nRussian sables. She thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot\\nbuttered roll, flashes out a tiny pair of scissors, snips off the\\nsecond button of your overcoat, meaningly ejaculates the one word,\\n\"parallelogram!\" and swiftly flies down a cross street, looking back\\nfearfully over her shoulder.\\n\\nThat would be pure adventure. Would you accept it? Not you. You would\\nflush with embarrassment; you would sheepishly drop the roll and\\ncontinue down Broadway, fumbling feebly for the missing button. This you\\nwould do unless you are one of the blessed few in whom the pure spirit\\nof adventure is not dead.\\n\\nTrue adventurers have never been plentiful. They who are set down in\\nprint as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods.\\nThey have been out after the things they wanted--golden fleeces, holy\\ngrails, lady loves, treasure, crowns and fame. The true adventurer goes\\nforth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate. A fine\\nexample was the Prodigal Son--when he started back home.\\n\\nHalf-adventurers--brave and splendid figures--have been numerous. From\\nthe Crusades to the Palisades they have enriched the arts of history\\nand fiction and the trade of historical fiction. But each of them had\\na prize to win, a goal to kick, an axe to grind, a race to run, a new\\nthrust in tierce to deliver, a name to carve, a crow to pick--so they\\nwere not followers of true adventure.\\n\\nIn the big city the twin spirits Romance and Adventure are always abroad\\nseeking worthy wooers. As we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and\\nchallenge us in twenty different guises. Without knowing why, we look up\\nsuddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery\\nof intimate portraits; in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony\\nand fear coming from an empty and shuttered house; instead of at our\\nfamiliar curb, a cab-driver deposits us before a strange door, which\\none, with a smile, opens for us and bids us enter; a slip of paper,\\nwritten upon, flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of\\nChance; we exchange glances of instantaneous hate, affection and\\nfear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds; a sudden douse of\\nrain--and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the Full Moon\\nand first cousin of the Sidereal System; at every corner handkerchiefs\\ndrop, fingers beckon, eyes besiege, and the lost, the lonely, the\\nrapturous, the mysterious, the perilous, changing clues of adventure are\\nslipped into our fingers. But few of us are willing to hold and follow\\nthem. We are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs.\\nWe pass on; and some day we come, at the end of a very dull life, to\\nreflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two,\\na satin rosette kept in a safe-deposit drawer, and a lifelong feud with\\na steam radiator.\\n\\nRudolf Steiner was a true adventurer. Few were the evenings on which he\\ndid not go forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected\\nand the egregious. The most interesting thing in life seemed to him to\\nbe what might lie just around the next corner. Sometimes his willingness\\nto tempt fate led him into strange paths. Twice he had spent the night\\nin a station-house; again and again he had found himself the dupe of\\ningenious and mercenary tricksters; his watch and money had been the\\nprice of one flattering allurement. But with undiminished ardour he\\npicked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists of adventure.\\n\\nOne evening Rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the\\nolder central part of the city. Two streams of people filled the\\nsidewalks--the home-hurrying, and that restless contingent that\\nabandons home for the specious welcome of the thousand-candle-power\\n_table d\\'hÃ´te_.\\n\\nThe young adventurer was of pleasing presence, and moved serenely and\\nwatchfully. By daylight he was a salesman in a piano store. He wore his\\ntie drawn through a topaz ring instead of fastened with a stick pin; and\\nonce he had written to the editor of a magazine that \"Junie\\'s Love Test\"\\nby Miss Libbey, had been the book that had most influenced his life.\\n\\nDuring his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the\\nsidewalk seemed at first to draw his attention (with a qualm), to a\\nrestaurant before which it was set; but a second glance revealed the\\nelectric letters of a dentist\\'s sign high above the next door. A giant\\nnegro, fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat, yellow trousers\\nand a military cap, discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing\\ncrowd who consented to take them.\\n\\nThis mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to Rudolf. Usually\\nhe passed the dispenser of the dentist\\'s cards without reducing his\\nstore; but tonight the African slipped one into his hand so deftly that\\nhe retained it there smiling a little at the successful feat.\\n\\nWhen he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card\\nindifferently. Surprised, he turned it over and looked again with\\ninterest. One side of the card was blank; on the other was written in\\nink three words, \"The Green Door.\" And then Rudolf saw, three steps in\\nfront of him, a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he\\npassed. Rudolf picked it up. It was printed with the dentist\\'s name and\\naddress and the usual schedule of \"plate work\" and \"bridge work\" and\\n\"crowns,\" and specious promises of \"painless\" operations.\\n\\nThe adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered. Then\\nhe crossed the street, walked down a block, recrossed and joined the\\nupward current of people again. Without seeming to notice the negro as\\nhe passed the second time, he carelessly took the card that was handed\\nhim. Ten steps away he inspected it. In the same handwriting that\\nappeared on the first card \"The Green Door\" was inscribed upon it. Three\\nor four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following\\nand leading him. These fell blank side up. Rudolf turned them over.\\nEvery one bore the printed legend of the dental \"parlours.\"\\n\\nRarely did the arch sprite Adventure need to beckon twice to Rudolf\\nSteiner, his true follower. But twice it had been done, and the quest\\nwas on.\\n\\nRudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of\\nrattling teeth. This time as he passed he received no card. In spite\\nof his gaudy and ridiculous garb, the Ethiopian displayed a natural\\nbarbaric dignity as he stood, offering the cards suavely to some,\\nallowing others to pass unmolested. Every half minute he chanted a\\nharsh, unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and\\ngrand opera. And not only did he withhold a card this time, but it\\nseemed to Rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black\\ncountenance a look of cold, almost contemptuous disdain.\\n\\nThe look stung the adventurer. He read in it a silent accusation that\\nhe had been found wanting. Whatever the mysterious written words on the\\ncards might mean, the black had selected him twice from the throng for\\ntheir recipient; and now seemed to have condemned him as deficient in\\nthe wit and spirit to engage the enigma.\\n\\nStanding aside from the rush, the young man made a rapid estimate of the\\nbuilding in which he conceived that his adventure must lie. Five stories\\nhigh it rose. A small restaurant occupied the basement.\\n\\nThe first floor, now closed, seemed to house millinery or furs. The\\nsecond floor, by the winking electric letters, was the dentist\\'s. Above\\nthis a polyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of\\npalmists, dressmakers, musicians and doctors. Still higher up draped\\ncurtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the\\nregions of domesticity.\\n\\nAfter concluding his survey Rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of\\nstone steps into the house. Up two flights of the carpeted stairway he\\ncontinued; and at its top paused. The hallway there was dimly lighted\\nby two pale jets of gas one--far to his right, the other nearer, to his\\nleft. He looked toward the nearer light and saw, within its wan halo,\\na green door. For one moment he hesitated; then he seemed to see the\\ncontumelious sneer of the African juggler of cards; and then he walked\\nstraight to the green door and knocked against it.\\n\\nMoments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the\\nquick breath of true adventure. What might not be behind those green\\npanels! Gamesters at play; cunning rogues baiting their traps with\\nsubtle skill; beauty in love with courage, and thus planning to be\\nsought by it; danger, death, love, disappointment, ridicule--any of\\nthese might respond to that temerarious rap.\\n\\nA faint rustle was heard inside, and the door slowly opened. A girl not\\nyet twenty stood there, white-faced and tottering. She loosed the knob\\nand swayed weakly, groping with one hand. Rudolf caught her and laid her\\non a faded couch that stood against the wall. He closed the door and\\ntook a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas\\njet. Neat, but extreme poverty was the story that he read.\\n\\nThe girl lay still, as if in a faint. Rudolf looked around the room\\nexcitedly for a barrel. People must be rolled upon a barrel who--no, no;\\nthat was for drowned persons. He began to fan her with his hat. That was\\nsuccessful, for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she\\nopened her eyes. And then the young man saw that hers, indeed, was the\\none missing face from his heart\\'s gallery of intimate portraits. The\\nfrank, grey eyes, the little nose, turning pertly outward; the chestnut\\nhair, curling like the tendrils of a pea vine, seemed the right end and\\nreward of all his wonderful adventures. But the face was wofully thin\\nand pale.\\n\\nThe girl looked at him calmly, and then smiled.\\n\\n\"Fainted, didn\\'t I?\" she asked, weakly. \"Well, who wouldn\\'t? You try\\ngoing without anything to eat for three days and see!\"\\n\\n\"Himmel!\" exclaimed Rudolf, jumping up. \"Wait till I come back.\"\\n\\nHe dashed out the green door and down the stairs. In twenty minutes he\\nwas back again, kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it.\\nWith both arms he hugged an array of wares from the grocery and the\\nrestaurant. On the table he laid them--bread and butter, cold meats,\\ncakes, pies, pickles, oysters, a roasted chicken, a bottle of milk and\\none of red-hot tea.\\n\\n\"This is ridiculous,\" said Rudolf, blusteringly, \"to go without eating.\\nYou must quit making election bets of this kind. Supper is ready.\" He\\nhelped her to a chair at the table and asked: \"Is there a cup for the\\ntea?\" \"On the shelf by the window,\" she answered. When he turned again\\nwith the cup he saw her, with eyes shining rapturously, beginning upon\\na huge Dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a\\nwoman\\'s unerring instinct. He took it from her, laughingly, and poured\\nthe cup full of milk. \"Drink that first\" he ordered, \"and then you shall\\nhave some tea, and then a chicken wing. If you are very good you shall\\nhave a pickle to-morrow. And now, if you\\'ll allow me to be your guest\\nwe\\'ll have supper.\"\\n\\nHe drew up the other chair. The tea brightened the girl\\'s eyes and\\nbrought back some of her colour. She began to eat with a sort of dainty\\nferocity like some starved wild animal. She seemed to regard the young\\nman\\'s presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thing--not\\nas though she undervalued the conventions; but as one whose great stress\\ngave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human. But\\ngradually, with the return of strength and comfort, came also a sense of\\nthe little conventions that belong; and she began to tell him her little\\nstory. It was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day--the\\nshop girl\\'s story of insufficient wages, further reduced by \"fines\" that\\ngo to swell the store\\'s profits; of time lost through illness; and then\\nof lost positions, lost hope, and--the knock of the adventurer upon the\\ngreen door.\\n\\nBut to Rudolf the history sounded as big as the Iliad or the crisis in\\n\"Junie\\'s Love Test.\"\\n\\n\"To think of you going through all that,\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\"It was something fierce,\" said the girl, solemnly.\\n\\n\"And you have no relatives or friends in the city?\"\\n\\n\"None whatever.\"\\n\\n\"I am all alone in the world, too,\" said Rudolf, after a pause.\\n\\n\"I am glad of that,\" said the girl, promptly; and somehow it pleased the\\nyoung man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition.\\n\\nVery suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply.\\n\\n\"I\\'m awfully sleepy,\" she said, \"and I feel so good.\"\\n\\nThen Rudolf rose and took his hat. \"I\\'ll say good-night. A long night\\'s\\nsleep will be fine for you.\"\\n\\nHe held out his hand, and she took it and said \"good-night.\" But her\\neyes asked a question so eloquently, so frankly and pathetically that\\nhe answered it with words.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m coming back to-morrow to see how you are getting along. You\\ncan\\'t get rid of me so easily.\"\\n\\nThen, at the door, as though the way of his coming had been so much less\\nimportant than the fact that he had come, she asked: \"How did you come\\nto knock at my door?\"\\n\\nHe looked at her for a moment, remembering the cards, and felt a sudden\\njealous pain. What if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous\\nas his? Quickly he decided that she must never know the truth. He would\\nnever let her know that he was aware of the strange expedient to which\\nshe had been driven by her great distress.\\n\\n\"One of our piano tuners lives in this house,\" he said. \"I knocked at\\nyour door by mistake.\"\\n\\nThe last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her\\nsmile.\\n\\nAt the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him.\\nAnd then he went along the hallway to its other end; and, coming back,\\nascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations.\\nEvery door that he found in the house was painted green.\\n\\nWondering, he descended to the sidewalk. The fantastic African was still\\nthere. Rudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand.\\n\\n\"Will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean?\" he\\nasked.\\n\\nIn a broad, good-natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid\\nadvertisement of his master\\'s profession.\\n\\n\"Dar it is, boss,\" he said, pointing down the street. \"But I \\'spect you\\nis a little late for de fust act.\"\\n\\nLooking the way he pointed Rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre\\nthe blazing electric sign of its new play, \"The Green Door.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m informed dat it\\'s a fust-rate show, sah,\" said the negro. \"De agent\\nwhat represents it pussented me with a dollar, sah, to distribute a few\\nof his cards along with de doctah\\'s. May I offer you one of de doctah\\'s\\ncards, sah?\"\\n\\nAt the corner of the block in which he lived Rudolf stopped for a glass\\nof beer and a cigar. When he had come out with his lighted weed he\\nbuttoned his coat, pushed back his hat and said, stoutly, to the lamp\\npost on the corner:\\n\\n\"All the same, I believe it was the hand of Fate that doped out the way\\nfor me to find her.\"\\n\\nWhich conclusion, under the circumstances, certainly admits Rudolf\\nSteiner to the ranks of the true followers of Romance and Adventure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFROM THE CABBY\\'S SEAT\\n\\n\\nThe cabby has his point of view. It is more single-minded, perhaps, than\\nthat of a follower of any other calling. From the high, swaying seat\\nof his hansom he looks upon his fellow-men as nomadic particles, of no\\naccount except when possessed of migratory desires. He is Jehu, and you\\nare goods in transit. Be you President or vagabond, to cabby you are\\nonly a Fare, he takes you up, cracks his whip, joggles your vertebrae\\nand sets you down.\\n\\nWhen time for payment arrives, if you exhibit a familiarity with legal\\nrates you come to know what contempt is; if you find that you have left\\nyour pocketbook behind you are made to realise the mildness of Dante\\'s\\nimagination.\\n\\nIt is not an extravagant theory that the cabby\\'s singleness of purpose\\nand concentrated view of life are the results of the hansom\\'s peculiar\\nconstruction. The cock-of-the-roost sits aloft like Jupiter on an\\nunsharable seat, holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant\\nleather. Helpless, ridiculous, confined, bobbing like a toy mandarin,\\nyou sit like a rat in a trap--you, before whom butlers cringe on solid\\nland--and must squeak upward through a slit in your peripatetic\\nsarcophagus to make your feeble wishes known.\\n\\nThen, in a cab, you are not even an occupant; you are contents. You are\\na cargo at sea, and the \"cherub that sits up aloft\" has Davy Jones\\'s\\nstreet and number by heart.\\n\\nOne night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenement-house\\nnext door but one to McGary\\'s Family CafÃ©. The sounds seemed to emanate\\nfrom the apartments of the Walsh family. The sidewalk was obstructed by\\nan assortment of interested neighbours, who opened a lane from time to\\ntime for a hurrying messenger bearing from McGary\\'s goods pertinent to\\nfestivity and diversion. The sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment\\nand discussion from which it made no effort to eliminate the news that\\nNorah Walsh was being married.\\n\\nIn the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry-makers to\\nthe sidewalk. The uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them, and\\nupon the night air rose joyous cries, congratulations, laughter and\\nunclassified noises born of McGary\\'s oblations to the hymeneal scene.\\n\\nClose to the curb stood Jerry O\\'Donovan\\'s cab. Night-hawk was Jerry\\ncalled; but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its\\ndoors upon point lace and November violets. And Jerry\\'s horse! I am\\nwithin bounds when I tell you that he was stuffed with oats until one of\\nthose old ladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go about\\nhaving expressmen arrested, would have smiled--yes, smiled--to have seen\\nhim.\\n\\nAmong the shifting, sonorous, pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of\\nJerry\\'s high hat, battered by the winds and rains of many years; of his\\nnose like a carrot, battered by the frolicsome, athletic progeny of\\nmillionaires and by contumacious fares; of his brass-buttoned green\\ncoat, admired in the vicinity of McGary\\'s. It was plain that Jerry had\\nusurped the functions of his cab, and was carrying a \"load.\" Indeed, the\\nfigure may be extended and he be likened to a bread-waggon if we admit\\nthe testimony of a youthful spectator, who was heard to remark \"Jerry\\nhas got a bun.\"\\n\\nFrom somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin\\nstream of pedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab. The\\nprofessional hawk\\'s eye of Jerry caught the movement. He made a lurch\\nfor the cab, overturning three or four onlookers and himself--no! he\\ncaught the cap of a water-plug and kept his feet. Like a sailor shinning\\nup the ratlins during a squall Jerry mounted to his professional seat.\\nOnce he was there McGary\\'s liquids were baffled. He seesawed on the\\nmizzenmast of his craft as safe as a Steeple Jack rigged to the flagpole\\nof a skyscraper.\\n\\n\"Step in, lady,\" said Jerry, gathering his lines. The young woman\\nstepped into the cab; the doors shut with a bang; Jerry\\'s whip cracked\\nin the air; the crowd in the gutter scattered, and the fine hansom\\ndashed away \\'crosstown.\\n\\nWhen the oat-spry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed\\nJerry broke the lid of his cab and called down through the aperture in\\nthe voice of a cracked megaphone, trying to please:\\n\\n\"Where, now, will ye be drivin\\' to?\"\\n\\n\"Anywhere you please,\" came up the answer, musical and contented.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis drivin\\' for pleasure she is,\" thought Jerry. And then he suggested\\nas a matter of course:\\n\\n\"Take a thrip around in the park, lady. \\'Twill be ilegant cool and\\nfine.\"\\n\\n\"Just as you like,\" answered the fare, pleasantly.\\n\\nThe cab headed for Fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street. Jerry\\nbounced and swayed in his seat. The potent fluids of McGary were\\ndisquieted and they sent new fumes to his head. He sang an ancient\\nsong of Killisnook and brandished his whip like a baton.\\n\\nInside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions, looking to\\nright and left at the lights and houses. Even in the shadowed hansom\\nher eyes shone like stars at twilight.\\n\\nWhen they reached Fifty-ninth street Jerry\\'s head was bobbing and his\\nreins were slack. But his horse turned in through the park gate and\\nbegan the old familiar nocturnal round. And then the fare leaned back,\\nentranced, and breathed deep the clean, wholesome odours of grass and\\nleaf and bloom. And the wise beast in the shafts, knowing his ground,\\nstruck into his by-the-hour gait and kept to the right of the road.\\n\\nHabit also struggled successfully against Jerry\\'s increasing torpor. He\\nraised the hatch of his storm-tossed vessel and made the inquiry that\\ncabbies do make in the park.\\n\\n\"Like shtop at the Cas-sino, lady? Gezzer r\\'freshm\\'s, \\'n lish\\'n the\\nmusic. Ev\\'body shtops.\"\\n\\n\"I think that would be nice,\" said the fare.\\n\\nThey reined up with a plunge at the Casino entrance. The cab doors flew\\nopen. The fare stepped directly upon the floor. At once she was caught\\nin a web of ravishing music and dazzled by a panorama of lights and\\ncolours. Some one slipped a little square card into her hand on which\\nwas printed a number--34. She looked around and saw her cab twenty yards\\naway already lining up in its place among the waiting mass of carriages,\\ncabs and motor cars. And then a man who seemed to be all shirt-front\\ndanced backward before her; and next she was seated at a little table by\\na railing over which climbed a jessamine vine.\\n\\nThere seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase; she consulted\\na collection of small coins in a thin purse, and received from them\\nlicense to order a glass of beer. There she sat, inhaling and absorbing\\nit all--the new-coloured, new-shaped life in a fairy palace in an\\nenchanted wood.\\n\\nAt fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of\\nthe world. And now and then one of them would look curiously at Jerry\\'s\\nfare. They saw a plain figure dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is\\ntempered by the word \"foulard,\" and a plain face that wore a look of\\nlove of life that the queens envied.\\n\\nTwice the long hands of the clocks went round, Royalties thinned from\\ntheir _al fresco_ thrones, and buzzed or clattered away in their\\nvehicles of state. The music retired into cases of wood and bags of\\nleather and baize. Waiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain\\nfigure sitting almost alone.\\n\\nJerry\\'s fare rose, and held out her numbered card simply:\\n\\n\"Is there anything coming on the ticket?\" she asked.\\n\\nA waiter told her it was her cab check, and that she should give it to\\nthe man at the entrance. This man took it, and called the number. Only\\nthree hansoms stood in line. The driver of one of them went and routed\\nout Jerry asleep in his cab. He swore deeply, climbed to the captain\\'s\\nbridge and steered his craft to the pier. His fare entered, and the cab\\nwhirled into the cool fastnesses of the park along the shortest homeward\\ncuts.\\n\\nAt the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized\\nupon Jerry\\'s beclouded mind. One or two things occurred to him. He\\nstopped his horse, raised the trap and dropped his phonographic voice,\\nlike a lead plummet, through the aperture:\\n\\n\"I want to see four dollars before goin\\' any further on th\\' thrip. Have\\nye got th\\' dough?\"\\n\\n\"Four dollars!\" laughed the fare, softly, \"dear me, no. I\\'ve only got a\\nfew pennies and a dime or two.\"\\n\\nJerry shut down the trap and slashed his oat-fed horse. The clatter\\nof hoofs strangled but could not drown the sound of his profanity.\\nHe shouted choking and gurgling curses at the starry heavens; he cut\\nviciously with his whip at passing vehicles; he scattered fierce and\\never-changing oaths and imprecations along the streets, so that a late\\ntruck driver, crawling homeward, heard and was abashed. But he knew his\\nrecourse, and made for it at a gallop.\\n\\nAt the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up. He\\nflung wide the cab doors and tumbled heavily to the ground.\\n\\n\"Come on, you,\" he said, roughly.\\n\\nHis fare came forth with the Casino dreamy smile still on her plain\\nface. Jerry took her by the arm and led her into the police station. A\\ngray-moustached sergeant looked keenly across the desk. He and the cabby\\nwere no strangers.\\n\\n\"Sargeant,\" began Jerry in his old raucous, martyred, thunderous tones\\nof complaint. \"I\\'ve got a fare here that--\"\\n\\nJerry paused. He drew a knotted, red hand across his brow. The fog set\\nup by McGary was beginning to clear away.\\n\\n\"A fare, sargeant,\" he continued, with a grin, \"that I want to\\ninthroduce to ye. It\\'s me wife that I married at ould man Walsh\\'s this\\navening. And a divil of a time we had, \\'tis thrue. Shake hands wid th\\'\\nsargeant, Norah, and we\\'ll be off to home.\"\\n\\nBefore stepping into the cab Norah sighed profoundly.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had such a nice time, Jerry,\" said she.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAN UNFINISHED STORY\\n\\n\\nWe no longer groan and heap ashes upon our heads when the flames of\\nTophet are mentioned. For, even the preachers have begun to tell us\\nthat God is radium, or ether or some scientific compound, and that\\nthe worst we wicked ones may expect is a chemical reaction. This is\\na pleasing hypothesis; but there lingers yet some of the old, goodly\\nterror of orthodoxy.\\n\\nThere are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free\\nimagination, and without the possibility of being controverted. You may\\ntalk of your dreams; and you may tell what you heard a parrot say. Both\\nMorpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses; and your listener dare\\nnot attack your recital. The baseless fabric of a vision, then, shall\\nfurnish my theme--chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more\\nlimited field of pretty Polly\\'s small talk.\\n\\nI had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it\\nhad to do with the ancient, respectable, and lamented bar-of-judgment\\ntheory.\\n\\nGabriel had played his trump; and those of us who could not follow suit\\nwere arraigned for examination. I noticed at one side a gathering of\\nprofessional bondsmen in solemn black and collars that buttoned behind;\\nbut it seemed there was some trouble about their real estate titles; and\\nthey did not appear to be getting any of us out.\\n\\nA fly cop--an angel policeman--flew over to me and took me by the left\\nwing. Near at hand was a group of very prosperous-looking spirits\\narraigned for judgment.\\n\\n\"Do you belong with that bunch?\" the policeman asked.\\n\\n\"Who are they?\" was my answer.\\n\\n\"Why,\" said he, \"they are--\"\\n\\nBut this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should\\noccupy.\\n\\nDulcie worked in a department store. She sold Hamburg edging, or stuffed\\npeppers, or automobiles, or other little trinkets such as they keep in\\ndepartment stores. Of what she earned, Dulcie received six dollars per\\nweek. The remainder was credited to her and debited to somebody else\\'s\\naccount in the ledger kept by G---- Oh, primal energy, you say, Reverend\\nDoctor--Well then, in the Ledger of Primal Energy.\\n\\nDuring her first year in the store, Dulcie was paid five dollars per\\nweek. It would be instructive to know how she lived on that amount.\\nDon\\'t care? Very well; probably you are interested in larger amounts.\\nSix dollars is a larger amount. I will tell you how she lived on six\\ndollars per week.\\n\\nOne afternoon at six, when Dulcie was sticking her hat-pin within an\\neighth of an inch of her _medulla oblongata_, she said to her chum,\\nSadie--the girl that waits on you with her left side:\\n\\n\"Say, Sade, I made a date for dinner this evening with Piggy.\"\\n\\n\"You never did!\" exclaimed Sadie admiringly. \"Well, ain\\'t you the lucky\\none? Piggy\\'s an awful swell; and he always takes a girl to swell places.\\nHe took Blanche up to the Hoffman House one evening, where they have\\nswell music, and you see a lot of swells. You\\'ll have a swell time,\\nDulce.\"\\n\\nDulcie hurried homeward. Her eyes were shining, and her cheeks showed\\nthe delicate pink of life\\'s--real life\\'s--approaching dawn. It was\\nFriday; and she had fifty cents left of her last week\\'s wages.\\n\\nThe streets were filled with the rush-hour floods of people. The\\nelectric lights of Broadway were glowing--calling moths from miles, from\\nleagues, from hundreds of leagues out of darkness around to come in and\\nattend the singeing school. Men in accurate clothes, with faces like\\nthose carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors\\' homes, turned\\nand stared at Dulcie as she sped, unheeding, past them. Manhattan,\\nthe night-blooming cereus, was beginning to unfold its dead-white,\\nheavy-odoured petals.\\n\\nDulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation\\nlace collar with her fifty cents. That money was to have been spent\\notherwise--fifteen cents for supper, ten cents for breakfast, ten cents\\nfor lunch. Another dime was to be added to her small store of savings;\\nand five cents was to be squandered for licorice drops--the kind that\\nmade your cheek look like the toothache, and last as long. The licorice\\nwas an extravagance--almost a carouse--but what is life without\\npleasures?\\n\\nDulcie lived in a furnished room. There is this difference between a\\nfurnished room and a boardinghouse. In a furnished room, other people\\ndo not know it when you go hungry.\\n\\nDulcie went up to her room--the third floor back in a West Side\\nbrownstone-front. She lit the gas. Scientists tell us that the diamond\\nis the hardest substance known. Their mistake. Landladies know of a\\ncompound beside which the diamond is as putty. They pack it in the tips\\nof gas-burners; and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain\\nuntil one\\'s fingers are pink and bruised. A hairpin will not remove it;\\ntherefore let us call it immovable.\\n\\nSo Dulcie lit the gas. In its one-fourth-candlepower glow we will\\nobserve the room.\\n\\nCouch-bed, dresser, table, washstand, chair--of this much the landlady\\nwas guilty. The rest was Dulcie\\'s. On the dresser were her treasures--a\\ngilt china vase presented to her by Sadie, a calendar issued by a pickle\\nworks, a book on the divination of dreams, some rice powder in a glass\\ndish, and a cluster of artificial cherries tied with a pink ribbon.\\n\\nAgainst the wrinkly mirror stood pictures of General Kitchener, William\\nMuldoon, the Duchess of Marlborough, and Benvenuto Cellini. Against one\\nwall was a plaster of Paris plaque of an O\\'Callahan in a Roman helmet.\\nNear it was a violent oleograph of a lemon-coloured child assaulting an\\ninflammatory butterfly. This was Dulcie\\'s final judgment in art; but\\nit had never been upset. Her rest had never been disturbed by whispers\\nof stolen copes; no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile\\nentomologist.\\n\\nPiggy was to call for her at seven. While she swiftly makes ready, let\\nus discreetly face the other way and gossip.\\n\\nFor the room, Dulcie paid two dollars per week. On week-days her\\nbreakfast cost ten cents; she made coffee and cooked an egg over the\\ngaslight while she was dressing. On Sunday mornings she feasted royally\\non veal chops and pineapple fritters at \"Billy\\'s\" restaurant, at a\\ncost of twenty-five cents--and tipped the waitress ten cents. New York\\npresents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance. She had\\nher lunches in the department-store restaurant at a cost of sixty cents\\nfor the week; dinners were $1.05. The evening papers--show me a New\\nYorker going without his daily paper!--came to six cents; and two\\nSunday papers--one for the personal column and the other to read--were\\nten cents. The total amounts to $4.76. Now, one has to buy clothes,\\nand--\\n\\nI give it up. I hear of wonderful bargains in fabrics, and of miracles\\nperformed with needle and thread; but I am in doubt. I hold my pen\\npoised in vain when I would add to Dulcie\\'s life some of those joys\\nthat belong to woman by virtue of all the unwritten, sacred, natural,\\ninactive ordinances of the equity of heaven. Twice she had been to Coney\\nIsland and had ridden the hobby-horses. \\'Tis a weary thing to count your\\npleasures by summers instead of by hours.\\n\\nPiggy needs but a word. When the girls named him, an undeserving stigma\\nwas cast upon the noble family of swine. The words-of-three-letters\\nlesson in the old blue spelling book begins with Piggy\\'s biography.\\nHe was fat; he had the soul of a rat, the habits of a bat, and the\\nmagnanimity of a cat. . . He wore expensive clothes; and was a\\nconnoisseur in starvation. He could look at a shop-girl and tell you\\nto an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more\\nnourishing than marshmallows and tea. He hung about the shopping\\ndistricts, and prowled around in department stores with his invitations\\nto dinner. Men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string\\nlook down upon him. He is a type; I can dwell upon him no longer; my\\npen is not the kind intended for him; I am no carpenter.\\n\\nAt ten minutes to seven Dulcie was ready. She looked at herself in the\\nwrinkly mirror. The reflection was satisfactory. The dark blue dress,\\nfitting without a wrinkle, the hat with its jaunty black feather, the\\nbut-slightly-soiled gloves--all representing self-denial, even of food\\nitself--were vastly becoming.\\n\\nDulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was\\nbeautiful, and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious\\nveil for her to observe its wonders. No gentleman had ever asked her\\nout before. Now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and\\nexalted show.\\n\\nThe girls said that Piggy was a \"spender.\" There would be a grand\\ndinner, and music, and splendidly dressed ladies to look at, and things\\nto eat that strangely twisted the girls\\' jaws when they tried to tell\\nabout them. No doubt she would be asked out again. There was a blue\\npongee suit in a window that she knew--by saving twenty cents a week\\ninstead of ten, in--let\\'s see--Oh, it would run into years! But there\\nwas a second-hand store in Seventh Avenue where--\\n\\nSomebody knocked at the door. Dulcie opened it. The landlady stood there\\nwith a spurious smile, sniffing for cooking by stolen gas.\\n\\n\"A gentleman\\'s downstairs to see you,\" she said. \"Name is Mr. Wiggins.\"\\n\\nBy such epithet was Piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him\\nseriously.\\n\\nDulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief; and then she\\nstopped still, and bit her underlip hard. While looking in her mirror\\nshe had seen fairyland and herself, a princess, just awakening from a\\nlong slumber. She had forgotten one that was watching her with sad,\\nbeautiful, stern eyes--the only one there was to approve or condemn\\nwhat she did. Straight and slender and tall, with a look of sorrowful\\nreproach on his handsome, melancholy face, General Kitchener fixed his\\nwonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser.\\n\\nDulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady.\\n\\n\"Tell him I can\\'t go,\" she said dully. \"Tell him I\\'m sick, or something.\\nTell him I\\'m not going out.\"\\n\\nAfter the door was closed and locked, Dulcie fell upon her bed, crushing\\nher black tip, and cried for ten minutes. General Kitchener was her only\\nfriend. He was Dulcie\\'s ideal of a gallant knight. He looked as if he\\nmight have a secret sorrow, and his wonderful moustache was a dream, and\\nshe was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes. She\\nused to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime,\\nand ask for her, with his sword clanking against his high boots. Once,\\nwhen a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp-post she had\\nopened the window and looked out. But there was no use. She knew that\\nGeneral Kitchener was away over in Japan, leading his army against the\\nsavage Turks; and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her. Yet\\none look from him had vanquished Piggy that night. Yes, for that night.\\n\\nWhen her cry was over Dulcie got up and took off her best dress, and put\\non her old blue kimono. She wanted no dinner. She sang two verses of\\n\"Sammy.\" Then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on\\nthe side of her nose. And after that was attended to, she drew up a\\nchair to the rickety table, and told her fortune with an old deck of\\ncards.\\n\\n\"The horrid, impudent thing!\" she said aloud. \"And I never gave him a\\nword or a look to make him think it!\"\\n\\nAt nine o\\'clock Dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of\\nraspberry jam out of her trunk, and had a feast. She offered General\\nKitchener some jam on a cracker; but he only looked at her as the sphinx\\nwould have looked at a butterfly--if there are butterflies in the\\ndesert.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t eat it if you don\\'t want to,\" said Dulcie. \"And don\\'t put on so\\nmany airs and scold so with your eyes. I wonder if you\\'d be so superior\\nand snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week.\"\\n\\nIt was not a good sign for Dulcie to be rude to General Kitchener. And\\nthen she turned Benvenuto Cellini face downward with a severe gesture.\\nBut that was not inexcusable; for she had always thought he was Henry\\nVIII, and she did not approve of him.\\n\\nAt half-past nine Dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the\\ndresser, turned out the light, and skipped into bed. It\\'s an awful\\nthing to go to bed with a good-night look at General Kitchener, William\\nMuldoon, the Duchess of Marlborough, and Benvenuto Cellini. This story\\nreally doesn\\'t get anywhere at all. The rest of it comes later--sometime\\nwhen Piggy asks Dulcie again to dine with him, and she is feeling\\nlonelier than usual, and General Kitchener happens to be looking the\\nother way; and then--\\n\\nAs I said before, I dreamed that I was standing near a crowd of\\nprosperous-looking angels, and a policeman took me by the wing and\\nasked if I belonged with them.\\n\\n\"Who are they?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Why,\" said he, \"they are the men who hired working-girls, and paid \\'em\\nfive or six dollars a week to live on. Are you one of the bunch?\"\\n\\n\"Not on your immortality,\" said I. \"I\\'m only the fellow that set fire to\\nan orphan asylum, and murdered a blind man for his pennies.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CALIPH, CUPID AND THE CLOCK\\n\\n\\nPrince Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna, sat on his favourite\\nbench in the park. The coolness of the September night quickened the\\nlife in him like a rare, tonic wine. The benches were not filled; for\\npark loungers, with their stagnant blood, are prompt to detect and fly\\nhome from the crispness of early autumn. The moon was just clearing the\\nroofs of the range of dwellings that bounded the quadrangle on the east.\\nChildren laughed and played about the fine-sprayed fountain. In the\\nshadowed spots fauns and hamadryads wooed, unconscious of the gaze of\\nmortal eyes. A hand organ--Philomel by the grace of our stage carpenter,\\nFancy--fluted and droned in a side street. Around the enchanted\\nboundaries of the little park street cars spat and mewed and the stilted\\ntrains roared like tigers and lions prowling for a place to enter. And\\nabove the trees shone the great, round, shining face of an illuminated\\nclock in the tower of an antique public building.\\n\\nPrince Michael\\'s shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the\\ncarefullest cobbler. The ragman would have declined any negotiations\\nconcerning his clothes. The two weeks\\' stubble on his face was grey\\nand brown and red and greenish yellow--as if it had been made up from\\nindividual contributions from the chorus of a musical comedy. No man\\nexisted who had money enough to wear so bad a hat as his.\\n\\nPrince Michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled. It was a diverting\\nthought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those\\nclose-ranged, bulky, window-lit mansions that faced him, if he chose. He\\ncould have matched gold, equipages, jewels, art treasures, estates and\\nacres with any Croesus in this proud city of Manhattan, and scarcely\\nhave entered upon the bulk of his holdings. He could have sat at table\\nwith reigning sovereigns. The social world, the world of art, the\\nfellowship of the elect, adulation, imitation, the homage of the\\nfairest, honours from the highest, praise from the wisest, flattery,\\nesteem, credit, pleasure, fame--all the honey of life was waiting in the\\ncomb in the hive of the world for Prince Michael, of the Electorate of\\nValleluna, whenever he might choose to take it. But his choice was to\\nsit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park. For he had tasted of\\nthe fruit of the tree of life, and, finding it bitter in his mouth,\\nhad stepped out of Eden for a time to seek distraction close to the\\nunarmoured, beating heart of the world.\\n\\nThese thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of Prince Michael, as\\nhe smiled under the stubble of his polychromatic beard. Lounging thus,\\nclad as the poorest of mendicants in the parks, he loved to study\\nhumanity. He found in altruism more pleasure than his riches, his\\nstation and all the grosser sweets of life had given him. It was his\\nchief solace and satisfaction to alleviate individual distress, to\\nconfer favours upon worthy ones who had need of succour, to dazzle\\nunfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of truly royal\\nmagnificence, bestowed, however, with wisdom and judiciousness.\\n\\nAnd as Prince Michael\\'s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great\\nclock in the tower, his smile, altruistic as it was, became slightly\\ntinged with contempt. Big thoughts were the Prince\\'s; and it was always\\nwith a shake of his head that he considered the subjugation of the world\\nto the arbitrary measures of Time. The comings and goings of people in\\nhurry and dread, controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock,\\nalways made him sad.\\n\\nBy and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third\\nbench from the Prince. For half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous\\nhaste, and then he fell to watching the face of the illuminated clock\\nabove the trees. His perturbation was evident, and the Prince noted, in\\nsorrow, that its cause was connected, in some manner, with the slowly\\nmoving hands of the timepiece.\\n\\nHis Highness arose and went to the young man\\'s bench.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon for addressing you,\" he said, \"but I perceive that\\nyou are disturbed in mind. If it may serve to mitigate the liberty I\\nhave taken I will add that I am Prince Michael, heir to the throne of\\nthe Electorate of Valleluna. I appear incognito, of course, as you may\\ngather from my appearance. It is a fancy of mine to render aid to others\\nwhom I think worthy of it. Perhaps the matter that seems to distress you\\nis one that would more readily yield to our mutual efforts.\"\\n\\nThe young man looked up brightly at the Prince. Brightly, but the\\nperpendicular line of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed\\naway. He laughed, and even then it did not. But he accepted the\\nmomentary diversion.\\n\\n\"Glad to meet you, Prince,\" he said, good humouredly. \"Yes, I\\'d say you\\nwere incog. all right. Thanks for your offer of assistance--but I don\\'t\\nsee where your butting-in would help things any. It\\'s a kind of private\\naffair, you know--but thanks all the same.\"\\n\\nPrince Michael sat at the young man\\'s side. He was often rebuffed but\\nnever offensively. His courteous manner and words forbade that.\\n\\n\"Clocks,\" said the Prince, \"are shackles on the feet of mankind. I have\\nobserved you looking persistently at that clock. Its face is that of a\\ntyrant, its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket; its hands\\nare those of a bunco steerer, who makes an appointment with you to your\\nruin. Let me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease\\nto order your affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t usually,\" said the young man. \"I carry a watch except when I\\'ve\\ngot my radiant rags on.\"\\n\\n\"I know human nature as I do the trees and grass,\" said the Prince, with\\nearnest dignity. \"I am a master of philosophy, a graduate in art, and I\\nhold the purse of a Fortunatus. There are few mortal misfortunes that I\\ncannot alleviate or overcome. I have read your countenance, and found\\nin it honesty and nobility as well as distress. I beg of you to accept\\nmy advice or aid. Do not belie the intelligence I see in your face by\\njudging from my appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles.\"\\n\\nThe young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly. When his\\ngaze strayed from the glowing horologue of time it rested intently upon\\na four-story red brick house in the row of dwellings opposite to where\\nhe sat. The shades were drawn, and the lights in many rooms shone dimly\\nthrough them.\\n\\n\"Ten minutes to nine!\" exclaimed the young man, with an impatient\\ngesture of despair. He turned his back upon the house and took a rapid\\nstep or two in a contrary direction.\\n\\n\"Remain!\" commanded Prince Michael, in so potent a voice that the\\ndisturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give her the ten minutes and then I\\'m off,\" he muttered, and\\nthen aloud to the Prince: \"I\\'ll join you in confounding all clocks, my\\nfriend, and throw in women, too.\"\\n\\n\"Sit down,\" said the Prince calmly. \"I do not accept your addition.\\nWomen are the natural enemies of clocks, and, therefore, the allies of\\nthose who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our\\nfollies and limit our pleasures. If you will so far confide in me I\\nwould ask you to relate to me your story.\"\\n\\nThe young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh.\\n\\n\"Your Royal Highness, I will,\" he said, in tones of mock deference. \"Do\\nyou see yonder house--the one with three upper windows lighted? Well,\\nat 6 o\\'clock I stood in that house with the young lady I am--that is,\\nI was--engaged to. I had been doing wrong, my dear Prince--I had been\\na naughty boy, and she had heard of it. I wanted to be forgiven, of\\ncourse--we are always wanting women to forgive us, aren\\'t we, Prince?\"\\n\\n\"\\'I want time to think it over,\\' said she. \\'There is one thing certain;\\nI will either fully forgive you, or I will never see your face again.\\nThere will be no half-way business. At half-past eight,\\' she said, \\'at\\nexactly half-past eight you may be watching the middle upper window of\\nthe top floor. If I decide to forgive I will hang out of that window a\\nwhite silk scarf. You will know by that that all is as was before, and\\nyou may come to me. If you see no scarf you may consider that everything\\nbetween us is ended forever.\\' That,\" concluded the young man bitterly,\\n\"is why I have been watching that clock. The time for the signal to\\nappear has passed twenty-three minutes ago. Do you wonder that I am a\\nlittle disturbed, my Prince of Rags and Whiskers?\"\\n\\n\"Let me repeat to you,\" said Prince Michael, in his even, well-modulated\\ntones, \"that women are the natural enemies of clocks. Clocks are an\\nevil, women a blessing. The signal may yet appear.\"\\n\\n\"Never, on your principality!\" exclaimed the young man, hopelessly. \"You\\ndon\\'t know Marian--of course. She\\'s always on time, to the minute. That\\nwas the first thing about her that attracted me. I\\'ve got the mitten\\ninstead of the scarf. I ought to have known at 8.31 that my goose was\\ncooked. I\\'ll go West on the 11.45 to-night with Jack Milburn. The jig\\'s\\nup. I\\'ll try Jack\\'s ranch awhile and top off with the Klondike and\\nwhiskey. Good-night--er--er--Prince.\"\\n\\nPrince Michael smiled his enigmatic, gentle, comprehending smile and\\ncaught the coat sleeve of the other. The brilliant light in the Prince\\'s\\neyes was softening to a dreamier, cloudy translucence.\\n\\n\"Wait,\" he said solemnly, \"till the clock strikes. I have wealth and\\npower and knowledge above most men, but when the clock strikes I am\\nafraid. Stay by me until then. This woman shall be yours. You have the\\nword of the hereditary Prince of Valleluna. On the day of your marriage\\nI will give you $100,000 and a palace on the Hudson. But there must be\\nno clocks in that palace--they measure our follies and limit our\\npleasures. Do you agree to that?\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said the young man, cheerfully, \"they\\'re a nuisance,\\nanyway--always ticking and striking and getting you late for dinner.\"\\n\\nHe glanced again at the clock in the tower. The hands stood at three\\nminutes to nine.\\n\\n\"I think,\" said Prince Michael, \"that I will sleep a little. The day\\nhas been fatiguing.\"\\n\\nHe stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept\\nthus before.\\n\\n\"You will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is\\nsuitable,\" said the Prince, sleepily. \"Come to me when your marriage\\nday is set and I will give you a cheque for the money.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks, Your Highness,\" said the young man, seriously. \"It doesn\\'t look\\nas if I would need that palace on the Hudson, but I appreciate your\\noffer, just the same.\"\\n\\nPrince Michael sank into deep slumber. His battered hat rolled from\\nthe bench to the ground. The young man lifted it, placed it over the\\nfrowsy face and moved one of the grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more\\ncomfortable position. \"Poor devil!\" he said, as he drew the tattered\\nclothes closer about the Prince\\'s breast.\\n\\nSonorous and startling came the stroke of 9 from the clock tower. The\\nyoung man sighed again, turned his face for one last look at the house\\nof his relinquished hopes--and cried aloud profane words of\\nholy rapture.\\n\\nFrom the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving, snowy,\\nfluttering, wonderful, divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy.\\n\\nBy came a citizen, rotund, comfortable, home-hurrying, unknowing of the\\ndelights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly-lit parks.\\n\\n\"Will you oblige me with the time, sir?\" asked the young man; and the\\ncitizen, shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe, dragged it out and\\nannounced:\\n\\n\"Twenty-nine and a half minutes past eight, sir.\"\\n\\nAnd then, from habit, he glanced at the clock in the tower, and made\\nfurther oration.\\n\\n\"By George! that clock\\'s half an hour fast! First time in ten years I\\'ve\\nknown it to be off. This watch of mine never varies a--\"\\n\\nBut the citizen was talking to vacancy. He turned and saw his hearer,\\na fast receding black shadow, flying in the direction of a house with\\nthree lighted upper windows.\\n\\nAnd in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats\\nthey owned. The park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that\\nsprawled, asleep, on a bench. They stopped and gazed upon it.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Dopy Mike,\" said one. \"He hits the pipe every night. Park bum for\\ntwenty years. On his last legs, I guess.\"\\n\\nThe other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp\\nin the hand of the sleeper.\\n\\n\"Gee!\" he remarked. \"He\\'s doped out a fifty-dollar bill, anyway. Wish\\nI knew the brand of hop that he smokes.\"\\n\\nAnd then \"Rap, rap, rap!\" went the club of realism against the shoe\\nsoles of Prince Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSISTERS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE\\n\\n\\nThe Rubberneck Auto was about ready to start. The merry top-riders had\\nbeen assigned to their seats by the gentlemanly conductor. The sidewalk\\nwas blockaded with sightseers who had gathered to stare at sightseers,\\njustifying the natural law that every creature on earth is preyed upon\\nby some other creature.\\n\\nThe megaphone man raised his instrument of torture; the inside of the\\ngreat automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee\\ndrinker. The top-riders nervously clung to the seats; the old lady from\\nValparaiso, Indiana, shrieked to be put ashore. But, before a wheel\\nturns, listen to a brief preamble through the cardiaphone, which shall\\npoint out to you an object of interest on life\\'s sightseeing tour.\\n\\nSwift and comprehensive is the recognition of white man for white man in\\nAfrican wilds; instant and sure is the spiritual greeting between mother\\nand babe; unhesitatingly do master and dog commune across the slight\\ngulf between animal and man; immeasurably quick and sapient are the\\nbrief messages between one and one\\'s beloved. But all these instances\\nset forth only slow and groping interchange of sympathy and thought\\nbeside one other instance which the Rubberneck coach shall disclose. You\\nshall learn (if you have not learned already) what two beings of all\\nearth\\'s living inhabitants most quickly look into each other\\'s hearts\\nand souls when they meet face to face.\\n\\nThe gong whirred, and the Glaring-at-Gotham car moved majestically upon\\nits instructive tour.\\n\\nOn the highest, rear seat was James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri,\\nand his Bride.\\n\\nCapitalise it, friend typo--that last word--word of words in the\\nepiphany of life and love. The scent of the flowers, the booty of the\\nbee, the primal drip of spring waters, the overture of the lark, the\\ntwist of lemon peel on the cocktail of creation--such is the bride. Holy\\nis the wife; revered the mother; galliptious is the summer girl--but the\\nbride is the certified check among the wedding presents that the gods\\nsend in when man is married to mortality.\\n\\nThe car glided up the Golden Way. On the bridge of the great cruiser the\\ncaptain stood, trumpeting the sights of the big city to his passengers.\\nWide-mouthed and open-eared, they heard the sights of the metropolis\\nthundered forth to their eyes. Confused, delirious with excitement\\nand provincial longings, they tried to make ocular responses to the\\nmegaphonic ritual. In the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals they saw\\nthe home of the Vanderbilts; in the busy bulk of the Grand Central depot\\nthey viewed, wonderingly, the frugal cot of Russell Sage. Bidden to\\nobserve the highlands of the Hudson, they gaped, unsuspecting, at the\\nupturned mountains of a new-laid sewer. To many the elevated railroad\\nwas the Rialto, on the stations of which uniformed men sat and made\\nchop suey of your tickets. And to this day in the outlying districts\\nmany have it that Chuck Connors, with his hand on his heart, leads\\nreform; and that but for the noble municipal efforts of one Parkhurst,\\na district attorney, the notorious \"Bishop\" Potter gang would have\\ndestroyed law and order from the Bowery to the Harlem River.\\n\\nBut I beg you to observe Mrs. James Williams--Hattie Chalmers that\\nwas--once the belle of Cloverdale. Pale-blue is the bride\\'s, if she\\nwill; and this colour she had honoured. Willingly had the moss rosebud\\nloaned to her cheeks of its pink--and as for the violet!--her eyes will\\ndo very well as they are, thank you. A useless strip of white chaf--oh,\\nno, he was guiding the auto car--of white chiffon--or perhaps it was\\ngrenadine or tulle--was tied beneath her chin, pretending to hold her\\nbonnet in place. But you know as well as I do that the hatpins did the\\nwork.\\n\\nAnd on Mrs. James Williams\\'s face was recorded a little library of the\\nworld\\'s best thoughts in three volumes. Volume No. 1 contained the\\nbelief that James Williams was about the right sort of thing. Volume\\nNo. 2 was an essay on the world, declaring it to be a very excellent\\nplace. Volume No. 3 disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest\\nseat in a Rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes\\nall understanding.\\n\\nJames Williams, you would have guessed, was about twenty-four. It will\\ngratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate. He was exactly\\ntwenty-three years, eleven months and twenty-nine days old. He was well\\nbuilt, active, strong-jawed, good-natured and rising. He was on his\\nwedding trip.\\n\\nDear kind fairy, please cut out those orders for money and 40 H. P.\\ntouring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the\\nboat club. Instead of any of them turn backward--oh, turn backward and\\ngive us just a teeny-weeny bit of our wedding trip over again. Just an\\nhour, dear fairy, so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees\\nlooked, and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin--even\\nif it was the hatpins that did the work. Can\\'t do it? Very well; hurry\\nup with that touring car and the oil stock, then.\\n\\nJust in front of Mrs. James Williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket\\nand a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses. Only in dreams and\\nmilliners\\' shops do we, alas! gather grapes and roses at one swipe.\\nThis girl gazed with large blue eyes, credulous, when the megaphone man\\nroared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should\\nbe concerned. Between blasts she resorted to Epictetian philosophy in\\nthe form of pepsin chewing gum.\\n\\nAt this girl\\'s right hand sat a young man about twenty-four. He\\nwas well-built, active, strong-jawed and good-natured. But if his\\ndescription seems to follow that of James Williams, divest it of\\nanything Cloverdalian. This man belonged to hard streets and sharp\\ncorners. He looked keenly about him, seeming to begrudge the asphalt\\nunder the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch.\\n\\nWhile the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry, let me whisper you\\nthrough the low-tuned cardiaphone to sit tight; for now things are about\\nto happen, and the great city will close over them again as over a scrap\\nof ticker tape floating down from the den of a Broad street bear.\\n\\nThe girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the\\nlast seat. The other passengers she had absorbed; the seat behind her\\nwas her Bluebeard\\'s chamber.\\n\\nHer eyes met those of Mrs. James Williams. Between two ticks of a watch\\nthey exchanged their life\\'s experiences, histories, hopes and fancies.\\nAnd all, mind you, with the eye, before two men could have decided\\nwhether to draw steel or borrow a match.\\n\\nThe bride leaned forward low. She and the girl spoke rapidly together,\\ntheir tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents--a comparison\\nthat is not meant to go further. Two smiles and a dozen nods closed\\nthe conference.\\n\\nAnd now in the broad, quiet avenue in front of the Rubberneck car a man\\nin dark clothes stood with uplifted hand. From the sidewalk another\\nhurried to join him.\\n\\nThe girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and\\nwhispered in his ear. That young man exhibited proof of ability to act\\npromptly. Crouching low, he slid over the edge of the car, hung lightly\\nfor an instant, and then disappeared. Half a dozen of the top-riders\\nobserved his feat, wonderingly, but made no comment, deeming it prudent\\nnot to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of\\nalighting in this bewildering city. The truant passenger dodged a hansom\\nand then floated past, like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van\\nand a florist\\'s delivery wagon.\\n\\nThe girl in the tan jacket turned again, and looked in the eyes of Mrs.\\nJames Williams. Then she faced about and sat still while the Rubberneck\\nauto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the\\nplainclothes man.\\n\\n\"What\\'s eatin\\' you?\" demanded the megaphonist, abandoning his\\nprofessional discourse for pure English.\\n\\n\"Keep her at anchor for a minute,\" ordered the officer. \"There\\'s a man\\non board we want--a Philadelphia burglar called \\'Pinky\\' McGuire. There\\nhe is on the back seat. Look out for the side, Donovan.\"\\n\\nDonovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at James Williams.\\n\\n\"Come down, old sport,\" he said, pleasantly. \"We\\'ve got you. Back to\\nSleepytown for yours. It ain\\'t a bad idea, hidin\\' on a Rubberneck,\\nthough. I\\'ll remember that.\"\\n\\nSoftly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor:\\n\\n\"Better step off, sir, and explain. The car must proceed on its tour.\"\\n\\nJames Williams belonged among the level heads. With necessary slowness\\nhe picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front\\nof the car. His wife followed, but she first turned her eyes and saw the\\nescaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind a\\ntree on the edge of the little park, not fifty feet away.\\n\\nDescended to the ground, James Williams faced his captors with a smile.\\nHe was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in Cloverdale\\nabout having been mistaken for a burglar. The Rubberneck coach lingered,\\nout of respect for its patrons. What could be a more interesting sight\\nthan this?\\n\\n\"My name is James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri,\" he said kindly, so\\nthat they would not be too greatly mortified. \"I have letters here that\\nwill show--\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll come with us, please,\" announced the plainclothes man. \"\\'Pinky\\'\\nMcGuire\\'s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds. A\\ndetective saw you on the Rubberneck up at Central Park and \\'phoned down\\nto take you in. Do your explaining at the station-house.\"\\n\\nJames Williams\\'s wife--his bride of two weeks--looked him in the face\\nwith a strange, soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks,\\nlooked him in the face and said:\\n\\n\"Go with \\'em quietly, \\'Pinky,\\' and maybe it\\'ll be in your favour.\"\\n\\nAnd then as the Glaring-at-Gotham car rolled away she turned and threw\\na kiss--his wife threw a kiss--at some one high up on the seats of the\\nRubberneck.\\n\\n\"Your girl gives you good advice, McGuire,\" said Donovan. \"Come on,\\nnow.\"\\n\\nAnd then madness descended upon and occupied James Williams. He pushed\\nhis hat far upon the back of his head.\\n\\n\"My wife seems to think I am a burglar,\" he said, recklessly. \"I never\\nheard of her being crazy; therefore I must be. And if I\\'m crazy, they\\ncan\\'t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness.\"\\n\\nWhereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops\\nhad to be whistled for, and afterwards the reserves, to disperse a few\\nthousand delighted spectators.\\n\\nAt the station-house the desk sergeant asked for his name.\\n\\n\"McDoodle, the Pink, or Pinky the Brute, I forget which,\" was James\\nWilliams\\'s answer. \"But you can bet I\\'m a burglar; don\\'t leave that\\nout. And you might add that it took five of \\'em to pluck the Pink. I\\'d\\nespecially like to have that in the records.\"\\n\\nIn an hour came Mrs. James Williams, with Uncle Thomas, of Madison\\nAvenue, in a respect-compelling motor car and proofs of the hero\\'s\\ninnocence--for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by\\nan automobile mfg. co.\\n\\nAfter the police had sternly reprimanded James Williams for imitating\\na copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the\\ndepartment was capable of, Mrs. Williams rearrested him and swept him\\ninto an angle of the station-house. James Williams regarded her with\\none eye. He always said that Donovan closed the other while somebody\\nwas holding his good right hand. Never before had he given her a word\\nof reproach or of reproof.\\n\\n\"If you can explain,\" he began rather stiffly, \"why you--\"\\n\\n\"Dear,\" she interrupted, \"listen. It was an hour\\'s pain and trial to\\nyou. I did it for her--I mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach. I\\nwas so happy, Jim--so happy with you that I didn\\'t dare to refuse that\\nhappiness to another. Jim, they were married only this morning--those\\ntwo; and I wanted him to get away. While they were struggling with you\\nI saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park. That\\'s\\nall of it, dear--I had to do it.\"\\n\\nThus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in\\nthe enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one. By\\nrice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings. But bride\\nknoweth bride at the glance of an eye. And between them swiftly passes\\ncomfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ROMANCE OF A BUSY BROKER\\n\\n\\nPitcher, confidential clerk in the office of Harvey Maxwell, broker,\\nallowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually\\nexpressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half\\npast nine in company with his young lady stenographer. With a snappy\\n\"Good-morning, Pitcher,\" Maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were\\nintending to leap over it, and then plunged into the great heap of\\nletters and telegrams waiting there for him.\\n\\nThe young lady had been Maxwell\\'s stenographer for a year. She was\\nbeautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic. She forewent\\nthe pomp of the alluring pompadour. She wore no chains, bracelets or\\nlockets. She had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to\\nluncheon. Her dress was grey and plain, but it fitted her figure with\\nfidelity and discretion. In her neat black turban hat was the gold-green\\nwing of a macaw. On this morning she was softly and shyly radiant. Her\\neyes were dreamily bright, her cheeks genuine peachblow, her expression\\na happy one, tinged with reminiscence.\\n\\nPitcher, still mildly curious, noticed a difference in her ways this\\nmorning. Instead of going straight into the adjoining room, where her\\ndesk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute, in the outer office. Once\\nshe moved over by Maxwell\\'s desk, near enough for him to be aware of\\nher presence.\\n\\nThe machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man; it was a busy New\\nYork broker, moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs.\\n\\n\"Well--what is it? Anything?\" asked Maxwell sharply. His opened mail\\nlay like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk. His keen grey eye,\\nimpersonal and brusque, flashed upon her half impatiently.\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" answered the stenographer, moving away with a little smile.\\n\\n\"Mr. Pitcher,\" she said to the confidential clerk, \"did Mr. Maxwell say\\nanything yesterday about engaging another stenographer?\"\\n\\n\"He did,\" answered Pitcher. \"He told me to get another one. I notified\\nthe agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning.\\nIt\\'s 9.45 o\\'clock, and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple\\nchewing gum has showed up yet.\"\\n\\n\"I will do the work as usual, then,\" said the young lady, \"until some\\none comes to fill the place.\" And she went to her desk at once and hung\\nthe black turban hat with the gold-green macaw wing in its accustomed\\nplace.\\n\\nHe who has been denied the spectacle of a busy Manhattan broker during a\\nrush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology. The\\npoet sings of the \"crowded hour of glorious life.\" The broker\\'s hour is\\nnot only crowded, but the minutes and seconds are hanging to all the\\nstraps and packing both front and rear platforms.\\n\\nAnd this day was Harvey Maxwell\\'s busy day. The ticker began to reel\\nout jerkily its fitful coils of tape, the desk telephone had a chronic\\nattack of buzzing. Men began to throng into the office and call at him\\nover the railing, jovially, sharply, viciously, excitedly. Messenger\\nboys ran in and out with messages and telegrams. The clerks in the\\noffice jumped about like sailors during a storm. Even Pitcher\\'s face\\nrelaxed into something resembling animation.\\n\\nOn the Exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and\\nglaciers and volcanoes, and those elemental disturbances were reproduced\\nin miniature in the broker\\'s offices. Maxwell shoved his chair against\\nthe wall and transacted business after the manner of a toe dancer. He\\njumped from ticker to \\'phone, from desk to door with the trained agility\\nof a harlequin.\\n\\nIn the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became\\nsuddenly aware of a high-rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding\\ncanopy of velvet and ostrich tips, an imitation sealskin sacque and a\\nstring of beads as large as hickory nuts, ending near the floor with\\na silver heart. There was a self-possessed young lady connected with\\nthese accessories; and Pitcher was there to construe her.\\n\\n\"Lady from the Stenographer\\'s Agency to see about the position,\" said\\nPitcher.\\n\\nMaxwell turned half around, with his hands full of papers and ticker\\ntape.\\n\\n\"What position?\" he asked, with a frown.\\n\\n\"Position of stenographer,\" said Pitcher. \"You told me yesterday to call\\nthem up and have one sent over this morning.\"\\n\\n\"You are losing your mind, Pitcher,\" said Maxwell. \"Why should I\\nhave given you any such instructions? Miss Leslie has given perfect\\nsatisfaction during the year she has been here. The place is hers as\\nlong as she chooses to retain it. There\\'s no place open here, madam.\\nCountermand that order with the agency, Pitcher, and don\\'t bring any\\nmore of \\'em in here.\"\\n\\nThe silver heart left the office, swinging and banging itself\\nindependently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed.\\nPitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that the \"old man\"\\nseemed to get more absent-minded and forgetful every day of the world.\\n\\nThe rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster. On the floor\\nthey were pounding half a dozen stocks in which Maxwell\\'s customers\\nwere heavy investors. Orders to buy and sell were coming and going\\nas swift as the flight of swallows. Some of his own holdings were\\nimperilled, and the man was working like some high-geared, delicate,\\nstrong machine--strung to full tension, going at full speed, accurate,\\nnever hesitating, with the proper word and decision and act ready and\\nprompt as clockwork. Stocks and bonds, loans and mortgages, margins\\nand securities--here was a world of finance, and there was no room in\\nit for the human world or the world of nature.\\n\\nWhen the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the uproar.\\n\\nMaxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and\\nmemoranda, with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging\\nin disorderly strings over his forehead. His window was open, for the\\nbeloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through the\\nwaking registers of the earth.\\n\\nAnd through the window came a wandering--perhaps a lost--odour--a\\ndelicate, sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment\\nimmovable. For this odour belonged to Miss Leslie; it was her own,\\nand hers only.\\n\\nThe odour brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world\\nof finance dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next\\nroom--twenty steps away.\\n\\n\"By George, I\\'ll do it now,\" said Maxwell, half aloud. \"I\\'ll ask her\\nnow. I wonder I didn\\'t do it long ago.\"\\n\\nHe dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to\\ncover. He charged upon the desk of the stenographer.\\n\\nShe looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek, and\\nher eyes were kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk. He\\nstill clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was above\\nhis ear.\\n\\n\"Miss Leslie,\" he began hurriedly, \"I have but a moment to spare. I want\\nto say something in that moment. Will you be my wife? I haven\\'t had time\\nto make love to you in the ordinary way, but I really do love you. Talk\\nquick, please--those fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of Union\\nPacific.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, what are you talking about?\" exclaimed the young lady. She rose to\\nher feet and gazed upon him, round-eyed.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you understand?\" said Maxwell, restively. \"I want you to marry\\nme. I love you, Miss Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I snatched a\\nminute when things had slackened up a bit. They\\'re calling me for\\nthe \\'phone now. Tell \\'em to wait a minute, Pitcher. Won\\'t you, Miss\\nLeslie?\"\\n\\nThe stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with\\namazement; then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she\\nsmiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly about\\nthe broker\\'s neck.\\n\\n\"I know now,\" she said, softly. \"It\\'s this old business that has driven\\neverything else out of your head for the time. I was frightened at\\nfirst. Don\\'t you remember, Harvey? We were married last evening at 8\\no\\'clock in the Little Church Around the Corner.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAFTER TWENTY YEARS\\n\\n\\nThe policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The\\nimpressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few.\\nThe time was barely 10 o\\'clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with\\na taste of rain in them had well nigh de-peopled the streets.\\n\\nTrying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and\\nartful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown\\nthe pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and slight\\nswagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The vicinity\\nwas one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of\\na cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the majority of the\\ndoors belonged to business places that had long since been closed.\\n\\nWhen about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his\\nwalk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an\\nunlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man\\nspoke up quickly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right, officer,\" he said, reassuringly. \"I\\'m just waiting for\\na friend. It\\'s an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little\\nfunny to you, doesn\\'t it? Well, I\\'ll explain if you\\'d like to make\\ncertain it\\'s all straight. About that long ago there used to be a\\nrestaurant where this store stands--\\'Big Joe\\' Brady\\'s restaurant.\"\\n\\n\"Until five years ago,\" said the policeman. \"It was torn down then.\"\\n\\nThe man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light\\nshowed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white\\nscar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly\\nset.\\n\\n\"Twenty years ago to-night,\" said the man, \"I dined here at \\'Big Joe\\'\\nBrady\\'s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the\\nworld. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers,\\ntogether. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was to\\nstart for the West to make my fortune. You couldn\\'t have dragged Jimmy\\nout of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well, we\\nagreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years\\nfrom that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from\\nwhat distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years\\neach of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made,\\nwhatever they were going to be.\"\\n\\n\"It sounds pretty interesting,\" said the policeman. \"Rather a long time\\nbetween meets, though, it seems to me. Haven\\'t you heard from your\\nfriend since you left?\"\\n\\n\"Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,\" said the other. \"But after a\\nyear or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty\\nbig proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But\\nI know Jimmy will meet me here if he\\'s alive, for he always was the\\ntruest, stanchest old chap in the world. He\\'ll never forget. I came a\\nthousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it\\'s worth it if my\\nold partner turns up.\"\\n\\nThe waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with\\nsmall diamonds.\\n\\n\"Three minutes to ten,\" he announced. \"It was exactly ten o\\'clock when\\nwe parted here at the restaurant door.\"\\n\\n\"Did pretty well out West, didn\\'t you?\" asked the policeman.\\n\\n\"You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder,\\nthough, good fellow as he was. I\\'ve had to compete with some of the\\nsharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York.\\nIt takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.\"\\n\\nThe policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to\\ncall time on him sharp?\"\\n\\n\"I should say not!\" said the other. \"I\\'ll give him half an hour at\\nleast. If Jimmy is alive on earth he\\'ll be here by that time. So long,\\nofficer.\"\\n\\n\"Good-night, sir,\" said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying\\ndoors as he went.\\n\\nThere was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from\\nits uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir\\nin that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars\\nturned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware store\\nthe man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain\\nalmost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and\\nwaited.\\n\\nAbout twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat,\\nwith collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite side\\nof the street. He went directly to the waiting man.\\n\\n\"Is that you, Bob?\" he asked, doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Is that you, Jimmy Wells?\" cried the man in the door.\\n\\n\"Bless my heart!\" exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other\\'s\\nhands with his own. \"It\\'s Bob, sure as fate. I was certain I\\'d find you\\nhere if you were still in existence. Well, well, well!--twenty years is\\na long time. The old restaurant\\'s gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so we\\ncould have had another dinner there. How has the West treated you, old\\nman?\"\\n\\n\"Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for. You\\'ve changed lots,\\nJimmy. I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty.\"\\n\\n\"Doing well in New York, Jimmy?\"\\n\\n\"Moderately. I have a position in one of the city departments. Come on,\\nBob; we\\'ll go around to a place I know of, and have a good long talk\\nabout old times.\"\\n\\nThe two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West,\\nhis egotism enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the history\\nof his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with\\ninterest.\\n\\nAt the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When\\nthey came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze\\nupon the other\\'s face.\\n\\nThe man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.\\n\\n\"You\\'re not Jimmy Wells,\" he snapped. \"Twenty years is a long time, but\\nnot long enough to change a man\\'s nose from a Roman to a pug.\"\\n\\n\"It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one,\" said the tall man.\\n\"You\\'ve been under arrest for ten minutes, \\'Silky\\' Bob. Chicago thinks\\nyou may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat\\nwith you. Going quietly, are you? That\\'s sensible. Now, before we go on\\nto the station here\\'s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it\\nhere at the window. It\\'s from Patrolman Wells.\"\\n\\nThe man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him. His\\nhand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by the\\ntime he had finished. The note was rather short.\\n\\n   \"_Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the\\n   match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in\\n   Chicago. Somehow I couldn\\'t do it myself, so I went around and got\\n   a plain clothes man to do the job.      JIMMY._\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLOST ON DRESS PARADE\\n\\n\\nMr. Towers chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom.\\nOne iron was heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed\\nvigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be\\nseen later on extending in straight lines from mr. Chandler\\'s patent\\nleather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest. So much of the hero\\'s\\ntoilet may be intrusted to our confidence. The remainder may be guessed\\nby those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient. Our next\\nview of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging-house\\nimmaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured, handsome--in\\nappearance the typical new york young clubman setting out, slightly\\nbored, to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening.\\n\\nChandler\\'s honorarium was $18 per week. He was employed in the office of\\nan architect. He was twenty-two years old; he considered architecture\\nto be truly an art; and he honestly believed--though he would not have\\ndared to admit it in New York--that the Flatiron Building was inferior\\nin design to the great cathedral in Milan.\\n\\nOut of each week\\'s earnings Chandler set aside $1. At the end of each\\nten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated, he purchased one\\ngentleman\\'s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old Father Time.\\nHe arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents; he\\ntook himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest, and\\nthere dined with taste and luxury. With ten dollars a man may, for a\\nfew hours, play the wealthy idler to perfection. The sum is ample for a\\nwell-considered meal, a bottle bearing a respectable label, commensurate\\ntips, a smoke, cab fare and the ordinary etceteras.\\n\\nThis one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to\\nChandler a source of renascent bliss. To the society bud comes but one\\ndÃ©but; it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened;\\nbut to Chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen, as thrilling, as\\nnew as the first had been. To sit among _bon vivants_ under palms in\\nthe swirl of concealed music, to look upon the _habituÃ©s_ of such a\\nparadise and to be looked upon by them--what is a girl\\'s first dance\\nand short-sleeved tulle compared with this?\\n\\nUp Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade. For this\\nevening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer. For the next sixty-nine\\nevenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious _table\\nd\\'hÃ´tes_, at whirlwind lunch counters, on sandwiches and beer in his\\nhall-bedroom. He was willing to do that, for he was a true son of the\\ngreat city of razzle-dazzle, and to him one evening in the limelight\\nmade up for many dark ones.\\n\\nChandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the\\ngreat and glittering primrose way, for the evening was yet young, and\\nwhen one is of the _beau monde_ only one day in seventy, one loves\\nto protract the pleasure. Eyes bright, sinister, curious, admiring,\\nprovocative, alluring were bent upon him, for his garb and air\\nproclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure.\\n\\nAt a certain corner he came to a standstill, proposing to himself the\\nquestion of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in\\nwhich he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury. Just then\\na girl scuddled lightly around the corner, slipped on a patch of icy\\nsnow and fell plump upon the sidewalk.\\n\\nChandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy.\\nThe girl hobbled to the wall of the building, leaned against it, and\\nthanked him demurely.\\n\\n\"I think my ankle is strained,\" she said. \"It twisted when I fell.\"\\n\\n\"Does it pain you much?\" inquired Chandler.\\n\\n\"Only when I rest my weight upon it. I think I will be able to walk in\\na minute or two.\"\\n\\n\"If I can be of any further service,\" suggested the young man, \"I will\\ncall a cab, or--\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said the girl, softly but heartily. \"I am sure you need not\\ntrouble yourself any further. It was so awkward of me. And my shoe heels\\nare horridly common-sense; I can\\'t blame them at all.\"\\n\\nChandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest.\\nShe was pretty in a refined way; and her eye was both merry and kind.\\nShe was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a\\nsort of uniform such as shop girls wear. Her glossy dark-brown hair\\nshowed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament\\nwas a velvet ribbon and bow. She could have posed as a model for the\\nself-respecting working girl of the best type.\\n\\nA sudden idea came into the head of the young architect. He would ask\\nthis girl to dine with him. Here was the element that his splendid but\\nsolitary periodic feasts had lacked. His brief season of elegant luxury\\nwould be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady\\'s society. This\\ngirl was a lady, he was sure--her manner and speech settled that. And in\\nspite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to\\nsit at table with her.\\n\\nThese thoughts passed swiftly through his mind, and he decided to\\nask her. It was a breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes\\nwage-earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind. They were\\ngenerally shrewd judges of men; and thought better of their own judgment\\nthan they did of useless conventions. His ten dollars, discreetly\\nexpended, would enable the two to dine very well indeed. The dinner\\nwould no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of\\nthe girl\\'s life; and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own\\ntriumph and pleasure.\\n\\n\"I think,\" he said to her, with frank gravity, \"that your foot needs a\\nlonger rest than you suppose. Now, I am going to suggest a way in which\\nyou can give it that and at the same time do me a favour. I was on my\\nway to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the\\ncorner. You come with me and we\\'ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant\\ntalk together, and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very\\nnicely, I am sure.\"\\n\\nThe girl looked quickly up into Chandler\\'s clear, pleasant countenance.\\nHer eyes twinkled once very brightly, and then she smiled ingenuously.\\n\\n\"But we don\\'t know each other--it wouldn\\'t be right, would it?\" she\\nsaid, doubtfully.\\n\\n\"There is nothing wrong about it,\" said the young man, candidly. \"I\\'ll\\nintroduce myself--permit me--Mr. Towers Chandler. After our dinner,\\nwhich I will try to make as pleasant as possible, I will bid you\\ngood-evening, or attend you safely to your door, whichever you prefer.\"\\n\\n\"But, dear me!\" said the girl, with a glance at Chandler\\'s faultless\\nattire. \"In this old dress and hat!\"\\n\\n\"Never mind that,\" said Chandler, cheerfully. \"I\\'m sure you look more\\ncharming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner\\ntoilette.\"\\n\\n\"My ankle does hurt yet,\" admitted the girl, attempting a limping step.\\n\"I think I will accept your invitation, Mr. Chandler. You may call\\nme--Miss Marian.\"\\n\\n\"Come then, Miss Marian,\" said the young architect, gaily, but with\\nperfect courtesy; \"you will not have far to walk. There is a very\\nrespectable and good restaurant in the next block. You will have to lean\\non my arm--so--and walk slowly. It is lonely dining all by one\\'s self.\\nI\\'m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice.\"\\n\\nWhen the two were established at a well-appointed table, with a\\npromising waiter hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience\\nthe real joy that his regular outing always brought to him.\\n\\nThe restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down\\nBroadway, which he always preferred, but it was nearly so. The tables\\nwere well filled with prosperous-looking diners, there was a good\\norchestra, playing softly enough to make conversation a possible\\npleasure, and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism. His\\ncompanion, even in her cheap hat and dress, held herself with an air\\nthat added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure.\\nAnd it is certain that she looked at Chandler, with his animated but\\nself-possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes, with\\nsomething not far from admiration in her own charming face.\\n\\nThen it was that the Madness of Manhattan, the frenzy of Fuss and\\nFeathers, the Bacillus of Brag, the Provincial Plague of Pose seized\\nupon Towers Chandler. He was on Broadway, surrounded by pomp and style,\\nand there were eyes to look at him. On the stage of that comedy he had\\nassumed to play the one-night part of a butterfly of fashion and an\\nidler of means and taste. He was dressed for the part, and all his good\\nangels had not the power to prevent him from acting it.\\n\\nSo he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs, of teas, of golf and\\nriding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out\\nhints of a yacht lying at Larchmont. He could see that she was vastly\\nimpressed by this vague talk, so he endorsed his pose by random\\ninsinuations concerning great wealth, and mentioned familiarly a few\\nnames that are handled reverently by the proletariat. It was Chandler\\'s\\nshort little day, and he was wringing from it the best that could be\\nhad, as he saw it. And yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this\\ngirl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and\\nall objects.\\n\\n\"This way of living that you speak of,\" she said, \"sounds so futile and\\npurposeless. Haven\\'t you any work to do in the world that might interest\\nyou more?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Marian,\" he exclaimed--\"work! Think of dressing every\\nday for dinner, of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon--with a\\npoliceman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to\\nthe station, if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart\\'s gait.\\nWe do-nothings are the hardest workers in the land.\"\\n\\nThe dinner was concluded, the waiter generously fed, and the two walked\\nout to the corner where they had met. Miss Marian walked very well now;\\nher limp was scarcely noticeable.\\n\\n\"Thank you for a nice time,\" she said, frankly. \"I must run home now. I\\nliked the dinner very much, Mr. Chandler.\"\\n\\nHe shook hands with her, smiling cordially, and said something about a\\ngame of bridge at his club. He watched her for a moment, walking rather\\nrapidly eastward, and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward.\\n\\nIn his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a\\nsixty-nine days\\' rest. He went about it thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"That was a stunning girl,\" he said to himself. \"She\\'s all right, too,\\nI\\'d be sworn, even if she does have to work. Perhaps if I\\'d told her\\nthe truth instead of all that razzle-dazzle we might--but, confound it!\\nI had to play up to my clothes.\"\\n\\nThus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe\\nof the Manhattans.\\n\\nThe girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until\\nshe arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east,\\nfacing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary\\ngods. Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a handsome\\nyoung lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously out the\\nwindow.\\n\\n\"Oh, you madcap!\" exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered.\\n\"When will you quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you\\nran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie\\'s hat. Mamma has been so\\nalarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You are a bad,\\nthoughtless Puss.\"\\n\\nThe elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment.\\n\\n\"Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo\\'s to tell her to use\\nmauve insertion instead of pink. My costume and Marie\\'s hat were just\\nwhat I needed. Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.\"\\n\\n\"I know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not\\nwalk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better.\\nThat is why I was so long.\"\\n\\nThe two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the\\nstream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue. The younger one cuddled down\\nwith her head in her sister\\'s lap.\\n\\n\"We will have to marry some day,\" she said dreamily--\"both of us. We\\nhave so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the public.\\nDo you want me to tell you the kind of a man I could love, Sis?\"\\n\\n\"Go on, you scatterbrain,\" smiled the other.\\n\\n\"I could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes, who is gentle and\\nrespectful to poor girls, who is handsome and good and does not try to\\nflirt. But I could love him only if he had an ambition, an object, some\\nwork to do in the world. I would not care how poor he was if I could\\nhelp him build his way up. But, sister dear, the kind of man we always\\nmeet--the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs--I\\ncould not love a man like that, even if his eyes were blue and he were\\never so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBY COURIER\\n\\n\\nIt was neither the season nor the hour when the Park had frequenters;\\nand it is likely that the young lady, who was seated on one of the\\nbenches at the side of the walk, had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to\\nsit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming Spring.\\n\\nShe rested there, pensive and still. A certain melancholy that touched\\nher countenance must have been of recent birth, for it had not yet\\naltered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek, nor subdued the\\narch though resolute curve of her lips.\\n\\nA tall young man came striding through the park along the path near\\nwhich she sat. Behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit-case. At sight of\\nthe young lady, the man\\'s face changed to red and back to pale again. He\\nwatched her countenance as he drew nearer, with hope and anxiety mingled\\non his own. He passed within a few yards of her, but he saw no evidence\\nthat she was aware of his presence or existence.\\n\\nSome fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench\\nat one side. The boy dropped the suit-case and stared at him with\\nwondering, shrewd eyes. The young man took out his handkerchief and\\nwiped his brow. It was a good handkerchief, a good brow, and the young\\nman was good to look at. He said to the boy:\\n\\n\"I want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench. Tell her\\nI am on my way to the station, to leave for San Francisco, where I shall\\njoin that Alaska moose-hunting expedition. Tell her that, since she has\\ncommanded me neither to speak nor to write to her, I take this means of\\nmaking one last appeal to her sense of justice, for the sake of what has\\nbeen. Tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such\\ntreatment, without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is\\ncontrary to her nature as I believe it to be. Tell her that I have thus,\\nto a certain degree, disobeyed her injunctions, in the hope that she may\\nyet be inclined to see justice done. Go, and tell her that.\"\\n\\nThe young man dropped a half-dollar into the boy\\'s hand. The boy looked\\nat him for a moment with bright, canny eyes out of a dirty, intelligent\\nface, and then set off at a run. He approached the lady on the bench a\\nlittle doubtfully, but unembarrassed. He touched the brim of the old\\nplaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head. The lady looked at\\nhim coolly, without prejudice or favour.\\n\\n\"Lady,\" he said, \"dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance by\\nme. If yer don\\'t know de guy, and he\\'s tryin\\' to do de Johnny act, say\\nde word, and I\\'ll call a cop in t\\'ree minutes. If yer does know him, and\\nhe\\'s on de square, w\\'y I\\'ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he sent yer.\"\\n\\nThe young lady betrayed a faint interest.\\n\\n\"A song and dance!\" she said, in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed\\nto clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony. \"A new\\nidea--in the troubadour line, I suppose. I--used to know the gentleman\\nwho sent you, so I think it will hardly be necessary to call the police.\\nYou may execute your song and dance, but do not sing too loudly. It is\\na little early yet for open-air vaudeville, and we might attract\\nattention.\"\\n\\n\"Awe,\" said the boy, with a shrug down the length of him, \"yer know what\\nI mean, lady. \\'Tain\\'t a turn, it\\'s wind. He told me to tell yer he\\'s got\\nhis collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to \\'Frisco. Den\\nhe\\'s goin\\' to shoot snow-birds in de Klondike. He says yer told him not\\nto send \\'round no more pink notes nor come hangin\\' over de garden gate,\\nand he takes dis means of puttin\\' yer wise. He says yer refereed him out\\nlike a has-been, and never give him no chance to kick at de decision. He\\nsays yer swiped him, and never said why.\"\\n\\nThe slightly awakened interest in the young lady\\'s eyes did not abate.\\nPerhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the\\nsnow-bird hunter, in thus circumventing her express commands against the\\nordinary modes of communication. She fixed her eye on a statue standing\\ndisconsolate in the dishevelled park, and spoke into the transmitter:\\n\\n\"Tell the gentleman that I need not repeat to him a description of my\\nideals. He knows what they have been and what they still are. So far\\nas they touch on this case, absolute loyalty and truth are the ones\\nparamount. Tell him that I have studied my own heart as well as one can,\\nand I know its weakness as well as I do its needs. That is why I decline\\nto hear his pleas, whatever they may be. I did not condemn him through\\nhearsay or doubtful evidence, and that is why I made no charge. But,\\nsince he persists in hearing what he already well knows, you may convey\\nthe matter.\\n\\n\"Tell him that I entered the conservatory that evening from the rear,\\nto cut a rose for my mother. Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton\\nbeneath the pink oleander. The tableau was pretty, but the pose and\\njuxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation. I\\nleft the conservatory, and, at the same time, the rose and my ideal.\\nYou may carry that song and dance to your impresario.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m shy on one word, lady. Jux--jux--put me wise on dat, will yer?\"\\n\\n\"Juxtaposition--or you may call it propinquity--or, if you like, being\\nrather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal.\"\\n\\nThe gravel spun from beneath the boy\\'s feet. He stood by the other\\nbench. The man\\'s eyes interrogated him, hungrily. The boy\\'s were shining\\nwith the impersonal zeal of the translator.\\n\\n\"De lady says dat she\\'s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a\\nfeller comes spielin\\' ghost stories and tryin\\' to make up, and dat\\'s\\nwhy she won\\'t listen to no soft-soap. She says she caught yer dead to\\nrights, huggin\\' a bunch o\\' calico in de hot-house. She side-stepped in\\nto pull some posies and yer was squeezin\\' de oder gal to beat de band.\\nShe says it looked cute, all right all right, but it made her sick. She\\nsays yer better git busy, and make a sneak for de train.\"\\n\\nThe young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden\\nthought. His hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat, and drew out a\\nhandful of letters. Selecting one, he handed it to the boy, following it\\nwith a silver dollar from his vest-pocket.\\n\\n\"Give that letter to the lady,\" he said, \"and ask her to read it. Tell\\nher that it should explain the situation. Tell her that, if she had\\nmingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal, much heartache\\nmight have been avoided. Tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much\\nhas never wavered. Tell her I am waiting for an answer.\"\\n\\nThe messenger stood before the lady.\\n\\n\"De gent says he\\'s had de ski-bunk put on him widout no cause. He says\\nhe\\'s no bum guy; and, lady, yer read dat letter, and I\\'ll bet yer he\\'s\\na white sport, all right.\"\\n\\nThe young lady unfolded the letter; somewhat doubtfully, and read it.\\n\\n\\n   DEAR DR. ARNOLD: I want to thank you for your most kind and\\n   opportune aid to my daughter last Friday evening, when she was\\n   overcome by an attack of her old heart-trouble in the conservatory\\n   at Mrs. Waldron\\'s reception. Had you not been near to catch her as\\n   she fell and to render proper attention, we might have lost her. I\\n   would be glad if you would call and undertake the treatment of her\\n   case.\\n   Gratefully yours,\\n   ROBERT ASHBURTON.\\n\\n\\nThe young lady refolded the letter, and handed it to the boy.\\n\\n\"De gent wants an answer,\" said the messenger. \"Wot\\'s de word?\"\\n\\nThe lady\\'s eyes suddenly flashed on him, bright, smiling and wet.\\n\\n\"Tell that guy on the other bench,\" she said, with a happy, tremulous\\nlaugh, \"that his girl wants him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE FURNISHED ROOM\\n\\n\\nRestless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk\\nof the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side.\\nHomeless, they have a hundred homes. They flit from furnished room to\\nfurnished room, transients forever--transients in abode, transients in\\nheart and mind. They sing \"Home, Sweet Home\" in ragtime; they carry\\ntheir _lares et penates_ in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a\\npicture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree.\\n\\nHence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers,\\nshould have a thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but it\\nwould be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the wake\\nof all these vagrant guests.\\n\\nOne evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red\\nmansions, ringing their bells. At the twelfth he rested his lean\\nhand-baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and\\nforehead. The bell sounded faint and far away in some remote, hollow\\ndepths.\\n\\nTo the door of this, the twelfth house whose bell he had rung, came a\\nhousekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome, surfeited worm that\\nhad eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy\\nwith edible lodgers.\\n\\nHe asked if there was a room to let.\\n\\n\"Come in,\" said the housekeeper. Her voice came from her throat; her\\nthroat seemed lined with fur. \"I have the third floor back, vacant since\\na week back. Should you wish to look at it?\"\\n\\nThe young man followed her up the stairs. A faint light from no\\nparticular source mitigated the shadows of the halls. They trod\\nnoiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn.\\nIt seemed to have become vegetable; to have degenerated in that rank,\\nsunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the\\nstaircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter. At each\\nturn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall. Perhaps plants had\\nonce been set within them. If so they had died in that foul and tainted\\nair. It may be that statues of the saints had stood there, but it was\\nnot difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in\\nthe darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below.\\n\\n\"This is the room,\" said the housekeeper, from her furry throat. \"It\\'s a\\nnice room. It ain\\'t often vacant. I had some most elegant people in it\\nlast summer--no trouble at all, and paid in advance to the minute. The\\nwater\\'s at the end of the hall. Sprowls and Mooney kept it three months.\\nThey done a vaudeville sketch. Miss B\\'retta Sprowls--you may have heard\\nof her--Oh, that was just the stage names--right there over the dresser\\nis where the marriage certificate hung, framed. The gas is here, and you\\nsee there is plenty of closet room. It\\'s a room everybody likes. It\\nnever stays idle long.\"\\n\\n\"Do you have many theatrical people rooming here?\" asked the young man.\\n\\n\"They comes and goes. A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with\\nthe theatres. Yes, sir, this is the theatrical district. Actor people\\nnever stays long anywhere. I get my share. Yes, they comes and they\\ngoes.\"\\n\\nHe engaged the room, paying for a week in advance. He was tired, he\\nsaid, and would take possession at once. He counted out the money. The\\nroom had been made ready, she said, even to towels and water. As the\\nhousekeeper moved away he put, for the thousandth time, the question\\nthat he carried at the end of his tongue.\\n\\n\"A young girl--Miss Vashner--Miss Eloise Vashner--do you remember such a\\none among your lodgers? She would be singing on the stage, most likely.\\nA fair girl, of medium height and slender, with reddish, gold hair and a\\ndark mole near her left eyebrow.\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t remember the name. Them stage people has names they change\\nas often as their rooms. They comes and they goes. No, I don\\'t call that\\none to mind.\"\\n\\nNo. Always no. Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable\\nnegative. So much time spent by day in questioning managers, agents,\\nschools and choruses; by night among the audiences of theatres from\\nall-star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find what\\nhe most hoped for. He who had loved her best had tried to find her. He\\nwas sure that since her disappearance from home this great, water-girt\\ncity held her somewhere, but it was like a monstrous quicksand, shifting\\nits particles constantly, with no foundation, its upper granules of\\nto-day buried to-morrow in ooze and slime.\\n\\nThe furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of\\npseudo-hospitality, a hectic, haggard, perfunctory welcome like the\\nspecious smile of a demirep. The sophistical comfort came in reflected\\ngleams from the decayed furniture, the ragged brocade upholstery of\\na couch and two chairs, a foot-wide cheap pier glass between the two\\nwindows, from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a\\ncorner.\\n\\nThe guest reclined, inert, upon a chair, while the room, confused in\\nspeech as though it were an apartment in Babel, tried to discourse to\\nhim of its divers tenantry.\\n\\nA polychromatic rug like some brilliant-flowered rectangular, tropical\\nislet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting. Upon the\\ngay-papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from\\nhouse to house--The Huguenot Lovers, The First Quarrel, The Wedding\\nBreakfast, Psyche at the Fountain. The mantel\\'s chastely severe\\noutline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn\\nrakishly askew like the sashes of the Amazonian ballet. Upon it was\\nsome desolate flotsam cast aside by the room\\'s marooned when a lucky\\nsail had borne them to a fresh port--a trifling vase or two, pictures\\nof actresses, a medicine bottle, some stray cards out of a deck.\\n\\nOne by one, as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit, the\\nlittle signs left by the furnished room\\'s procession of guests developed\\na significance. The threadbare space in the rug in front of the dresser\\ntold that lovely woman had marched in the throng. Tiny finger prints on\\nthe wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and\\nair. A splattered stain, raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb,\\nwitnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had splintered with its\\ncontents against the wall. Across the pier glass had been scrawled with\\na diamond in staggering letters the name \"Marie.\" It seemed that the\\nsuccession of dwellers in the furnished room had turned in fury--perhaps\\ntempted beyond forbearance by its garish coldness--and wreaked upon\\nit their passions. The furniture was chipped and bruised; the couch,\\ndistorted by bursting springs, seemed a horrible monster that had been\\nslain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion. Some more potent\\nupheaval had cloven a great slice from the marble mantel. Each plank in\\nthe floor owned its particular cant and shriek as from a separate and\\nindividual agony. It seemed incredible that all this malice and injury\\nhad been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time\\ntheir home; and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving\\nblindly, the resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled\\ntheir wrath. A hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish.\\n\\nThe young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file, soft-shod,\\nthrough his mind, while there drifted into the room furnished sounds\\nand furnished scents. He heard in one room a tittering and incontinent,\\nslack laughter; in others the monologue of a scold, the rattling of\\ndice, a lullaby, and one crying dully; above him a banjo tinkled\\nwith spirit. Doors banged somewhere; the elevated trains roared\\nintermittently; a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence. And he\\nbreathed the breath of the house--a dank savour rather than a smell--a\\ncold, musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the\\nreeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork.\\n\\nThen, suddenly, as he rested there, the room was filled with the strong,\\nsweet odour of mignonette. It came as upon a single buffet of wind with\\nsuch sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost seemed a living\\nvisitant. And the man cried aloud: \"What, dear?\" as if he had been\\ncalled, and sprang up and faced about. The rich odour clung to him and\\nwrapped him around. He reached out his arms for it, all his senses for\\nthe time confused and commingled. How could one be peremptorily called\\nby an odour? Surely it must have been a sound. But, was it not the sound\\nthat had touched, that had caressed him?\\n\\n\"She has been in this room,\" he cried, and he sprang to wrest from\\nit a token, for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that\\nhad belonged to her or that she had touched. This enveloping scent of\\nmignonette, the odour that she had loved and made her own--whence came\\nit?\\n\\nThe room had been but carelessly set in order. Scattered upon the\\nflimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins--those discreet,\\nindistinguishable friends of womankind, feminine of gender, infinite of\\nmood and uncommunicative of tense. These he ignored, conscious of their\\ntriumphant lack of identity. Ransacking the drawers of the dresser he\\ncame upon a discarded, tiny, ragged handkerchief. He pressed it to his\\nface. It was racy and insolent with heliotrope; he hurled it to the\\nfloor. In another drawer he found odd buttons, a theatre programme, a\\npawnbroker\\'s card, two lost marshmallows, a book on the divination of\\ndreams. In the last was a woman\\'s black satin hair bow, which halted\\nhim, poised between ice and fire. But the black satin hair-bow also is\\nfemininity\\'s demure, impersonal, common ornament, and tells no tales.\\n\\nAnd then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent, skimming the\\nwalls, considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and\\nknees, rummaging mantel and tables, the curtains and hangings, the\\ndrunken cabinet in the corner, for a visible sign, unable to perceive\\nthat she was there beside, around, against, within, above him, clinging\\nto him, wooing him, calling him so poignantly through the finer senses\\nthat even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call. Once again he\\nanswered loudly: \"Yes, dear!\" and turned, wild-eyed, to gaze on vacancy,\\nfor he could not yet discern form and colour and love and outstretched\\narms in the odour of mignonette. Oh, God! whence that odour, and since\\nwhen have odours had a voice to call? Thus he groped.\\n\\nHe burrowed in crevices and corners, and found corks and cigarettes.\\nThese he passed in passive contempt. But once he found in a fold of the\\nmatting a half-smoked cigar, and this he ground beneath his heel with a\\ngreen and trenchant oath. He sifted the room from end to end. He found\\ndreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant; but of\\nher whom he sought, and who may have lodged there, and whose spirit\\nseemed to hover there, he found no trace.\\n\\nAnd then he thought of the housekeeper.\\n\\nHe ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a\\ncrack of light. She came out to his knock. He smothered his excitement\\nas best he could.\\n\\n\"Will you tell me, madam,\" he besought her, \"who occupied the room I\\nhave before I came?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. I can tell you again. \\'Twas Sprowls and Mooney, as I said.\\nMiss B\\'retta Sprowls it was in the theatres, but Missis Mooney she was.\\nMy house is well known for respectability. The marriage certificate\\nhung, framed, on a nail over--\"\\n\\n\"What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls--in looks, I mean?\"\\n\\n\"Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face. They left\\na week ago Tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"And before they occupied it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business.\\nHe left owing me a week. Before him was Missis Crowder and her two\\nchildren, that stayed four months; and back of them was old Mr. Doyle,\\nwhose sons paid for him. He kept the room six months. That goes back a\\nyear, sir, and further I do not remember.\"\\n\\nHe thanked her and crept back to his room. The room was dead. The\\nessence that had vivified it was gone. The perfume of mignonette\\nhad departed. In its place was the old, stale odour of mouldy house\\nfurniture, of atmosphere in storage.\\n\\nThe ebbing of his hope drained his faith. He sat staring at the yellow,\\nsinging gaslight. Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the sheets\\ninto strips. With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly into\\nevery crevice around windows and door. When all was snug and taut he\\nturned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself\\ngratefully upon the bed.\\n\\n\\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\nIt was Mrs. McCool\\'s night to go with the can for beer. So she fetched\\nit and sat with Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where\\nhouse-keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom.\\n\\n\"I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,\" said Mrs. Purdy,\\nacross a fine circle of foam. \"A young man took it. He went up to bed\\ntwo hours ago.\"\\n\\n\"Now, did ye, Mrs. Purdy, ma\\'am?\" said Mrs. McCool, with intense\\nadmiration. \"You do be a wonder for rentin\\' rooms of that kind. And\\ndid ye tell him, then?\" she concluded in a husky whisper, laden with\\nmystery.\\n\\n\"Rooms,\" said Mrs. Purdy, in her furriest tones, \"are furnished for to\\nrent. I did not tell him, Mrs. McCool.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis right ye are, ma\\'am; \\'tis by renting rooms we kape alive. Ye have\\nthe rale sense for business, ma\\'am. There be many people will rayjict\\nthe rentin\\' of a room if they be tould a suicide has been after dyin\\'\\nin the bed of it.\"\\n\\n\"As you say, we has our living to be making,\" remarked Mrs. Purdy.\\n\\n\"Yis, ma\\'am; \\'tis true. \\'Tis just one wake ago this day I helped ye lay\\nout the third floor, back. A pretty slip of a colleen she was to be\\nkillin\\' herself wid the gas--a swate little face she had, Mrs. Purdy,\\nma\\'am.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'d a-been called handsome, as you say,\" said Mrs. Purdy, assenting\\nbut critical, \"but for that mole she had a-growin\\' by her left eyebrow.\\nDo fill up your glass again, Mrs. McCool.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BRIEF DÃ‰BUT OF TILDY\\n\\n\\nIf you do not know Bogle\\'s Chop House and Family Restaurant it is your\\nloss. For if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you\\nshould be interested to know how the other half consumes provisions. And\\nif you belong to the half to whom waiters\\' checks are things of moment,\\nyou should know Bogle\\'s, for there you get your money\\'s worth--in\\nquantity, at least.\\n\\nBogle\\'s is situated in that highway of _bourgeoisie_, that boulevard of\\nBrown-Jones-and-Robinson, Eighth Avenue. There are two rows of tables in\\nthe room, six in each row. On each table is a caster-stand, containing\\ncruets of condiments and seasons. From the pepper cruet you may shake a\\ncloud of something tasteless and melancholy, like volcanic dust. From\\nthe salt cruet you may expect nothing. Though a man should extract a\\nsanguinary stream from the pallid turnip, yet will his prowess be balked\\nwhen he comes to wrest salt from Bogle\\'s cruets. Also upon each table\\nstands the counterfeit of that benign sauce made \"from the recipe of a\\nnobleman in India.\"\\n\\nAt the cashier\\'s desk sits Bogle, cold, sordid, slow, smouldering, and\\ntakes your money. Behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change,\\nfiles your check, and ejects at you, like a toad, a word about the\\nweather. Beyond a corroboration of his meteorological statement you\\nwould better not venture. You are not Bogle\\'s friend; you are a fed,\\ntransient customer, and you and he may not meet again until the blowing\\nof Gabriel\\'s dinner horn. So take your change and go--to the devil if\\nyou like. There you have Bogle\\'s sentiments.\\n\\nThe needs of Bogle\\'s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a\\nVoice. One of the waitresses was named Aileen. She was tall, beautiful,\\nlively, gracious and learned in persiflage. Her other name? There\\nwas no more necessity for another name at Bogle\\'s than there was for\\nfinger-bowls.\\n\\nThe name of the other waitress was Tildy. Why do you suggest Matilda?\\nPlease listen this time--Tildy--Tildy. Tildy was dumpy, plain-faced, and\\ntoo anxious to please to please. Repeat the last clause to yourself once\\nor twice, and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite.\\n\\nThe Voice at Bogle\\'s was invisible. It came from the kitchen, and\\ndid not shine in the way of originality. It was a heathen Voice, and\\ncontented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the\\nwaitresses concerning food.\\n\\nWill it tire you to be told again that Aileen was beautiful? Had she\\ndonned a few hundred dollars\\' worth of clothes and joined the Easter\\nparade, and had you seen her, you would have hastened to say so\\nyourself.\\n\\nThe customers at Bogle\\'s were her slaves. Six tables full she could wait\\nupon at once. They who were in a hurry restrained their impatience for\\nthe joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving, graceful figure. They\\nwho had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the light\\nof her smiles. Every man there--and they were mostly men--tried to make\\nhis impression upon her.\\n\\nAileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once. And\\nevery smile that she sent forth lodged, like pellets from a scatter-gun,\\nin as many hearts. And all this while she would be performing\\nastounding feats with orders of pork and beans, pot roasts, ham-and,\\nsausage-and-the-wheats, and any quantity of things on the iron and in\\nthe pan and straight up and on the side. With all this feasting and\\nflirting and merry exchange of wit Bogle\\'s came mighty near being a\\nsalon, with Aileen for its Madame RÃ©camier.\\n\\nIf the transients were entranced by the fascinating Aileen, the\\nregulars were her adorers. There was much rivalry among many of the\\nsteady customers. Aileen could have had an engagement every evening.\\nAt least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance.\\nOne stout gentleman whom she and Tildy had privately christened \"The\\nHog\" presented her with a turquoise ring. Another one known as\\n\"Freshy,\" who rode on the Traction Company\\'s repair wagon, was going\\nto give her a poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract\\nin the Ninth. And the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and\\nsaid he was a stock broker asked her to go to \"Parsifal\" with him.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know where this place is,\" said Aileen while talking it over\\nwith Tildy, \"but the wedding-ring\\'s got to be on before I put a\\nstitch into a travelling dress--ain\\'t that right? Well, I guess!\"\\n\\nBut, Tildy!\\n\\nIn steaming, chattering, cabbage-scented Bogle\\'s there was almost a\\nheart tragedy. Tildy with the blunt nose, the hay-coloured hair, the\\nfreckled skin, the bag-o\\'-meal figure, had never had an admirer. Not\\na man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the\\nrestaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast-hunger\\nfor food. None of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges\\nof wit. None of them loudly \"jollied\" her of mornings as they did\\nAileen, accusing her, when the eggs were slow in coming, of late\\nhours in the company of envied swains. No one had ever given her a\\nturquoise ring or invited her upon a voyage to mysterious, distant\\n\"Parsifal.\"\\n\\nTildy was a good waitress, and the men tolerated her. They who sat\\nat her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of\\nfare; and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise-flavoured\\naccents, eloquently addressed to the fair Aileen. They writhed in\\ntheir chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of Tildy,\\nthat Aileen\\'s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their\\nbacon and eggs.\\n\\nAnd Tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if Aileen could\\nreceive the flattery and the homage. The blunt nose was loyal to the\\nshort Grecian. She was Aileen\\'s friend; and she was glad to see her\\nrule hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot-pie and\\nlemon meringue. But deep below our freckles and hay-coloured hair\\nthe unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess, not\\nvicarious, but coming to us alone.\\n\\nThere was a morning when Aileen tripped in to work with a slightly\\nbruised eye; and Tildy\\'s solicitude was almost enough to heal any\\noptic.\\n\\n\"Fresh guy,\" explained Aileen, \"last night as I was going home at\\nTwenty-third and Sixth. Sashayed up, so he did, and made a break.\\nI turned him down, cold, and he made a sneak; but followed me down to\\nEighteenth, and tried his hot air again. Gee! but I slapped him a\\ngood one, side of the face. Then he give me that eye. Does it look\\nreal awful, Til? I should hate that Mr. Nicholson should see it when\\nhe comes in for his tea and toast at ten.\"\\n\\nTildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration. No man\\nhad ever tried to follow her. She was safe abroad at any hour of the\\ntwenty-four. What bliss it must have been to have had a man follow\\none and black one\\'s eye for love!\\n\\nAmong the customers at Bogle\\'s was a young man named Seeders, who\\nworked in a laundry office. Mr. Seeders was thin and had light hair,\\nand appeared to have been recently rough-dried and starched. He was\\ntoo diffident to aspire to Aileen\\'s notice; so he usually sat at one\\nof Tildy\\'s tables, where he devoted himself to silence and boiled\\nweakfish.\\n\\nOne day when Mr. Seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer.\\nThere were only two or three customers in the restaurant. When Mr.\\nSeeders had finished his weakfish he got up, put his arm around\\nTildy\\'s waist, kissed her loudly and impudently, walked out upon the\\nstreet, snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry, and hied\\nhimself to play pennies in the slot machines at the Amusement Arcade.\\n\\nFor a few moments Tildy stood petrified. Then she was aware of\\nAileen shaking at her an arch forefinger, and saying:\\n\\n\"Why, Til, you naughty girl! Ain\\'t you getting to be awful, Miss\\nSlyboots! First thing I know you\\'ll be stealing some of my fellows.\\nI must keep an eye on you, my lady.\"\\n\\nAnother thing dawned upon Tildy\\'s recovering wits. In a moment she\\nhad advanced from a hopeless, lowly admirer to be an Eve-sister of\\nthe potent Aileen. She herself was now a man-charmer, a mark for\\nCupid, a Sabine who must be coy when the Romans were at their banquet\\nboards. Man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable.\\nThe sudden and amatory Seeders had, as it were, performed for her a\\nmiraculous piece of one-day laundry work. He had taken the sackcloth\\nof her uncomeliness, had washed, dried, starched and ironed it, and\\nreturned it to her sheer embroidered lawn--the robe of Venus herself.\\n\\nThe freckles on Tildy\\'s cheeks merged into a rosy flush. Now both\\nCirce and Psyche peeped from her brightened eyes. Not even Aileen\\nherself had been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant.\\n\\nTildy could not keep the delightful secret. When trade was slack she\\nwent and stood at Bogle\\'s desk. Her eyes were shining; she tried not\\nto let her words sound proud and boastful.\\n\\n\"A gentleman insulted me to-day,\" she said. \"He hugged me around the\\nwaist and kissed me.\"\\n\\n\"That so?\" said Bogle, cracking open his business armour. \"After\\nthis week you get a dollar a week more.\"\\n\\nAt the next regular meal when Tildy set food before customers with\\nwhom she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly, as one\\nwhose merit needed no bolstering:\\n\\n\"A gentleman insulted me to-day in the restaurant. He put his arm\\naround my waist and kissed me.\"\\n\\nThe diners accepted the revelation in various ways--some\\nincredulously, some with congratulations; others turned upon her the\\nstream of badinage that had hitherto been directed at Aileen alone.\\nAnd Tildy\\'s heart swelled in her bosom, for she saw at last the\\ntowers of Romance rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which\\nshe had for so long travelled.\\n\\nFor two days Mr. Seeders came not again. During that time Tildy\\nestablished herself firmly as a woman to be wooed. She bought\\nribbons, and arranged her hair like Aileen\\'s, and tightened her waist\\ntwo inches. She had a thrilling but delightful fear that Mr. Seeders\\nwould rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol. He must have\\nloved her desperately; and impulsive lovers are always blindly\\njealous.\\n\\nEven Aileen had not been shot at with a pistol. And then Tildy\\nrather hoped that he would not shoot at her, for she was always loyal\\nto Aileen; and she did not want to overshadow her friend.\\n\\nAt 4 o\\'clock on the afternoon of the third day Mr. Seeders came in.\\nThere were no customers at the tables. At the back end of the\\nrestaurant Tildy was refilling the mustard pots and Aileen was\\nquartering pies. Mr. Seeders walked back to where they stood.\\n\\nTildy looked up and saw him, gasped, and pressed the mustard spoon\\nagainst her heart. A red hair-bow was in her hair; she wore Venus\\'s\\nEighth Avenue badge, the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver\\nsymbolic heart.\\n\\nMr. Seeders was flushed and embarrassed. He plunged one hand into\\nhis hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie.\\n\\n\"Miss Tildy,\" said he, \"I want to apologise for what I done the other\\nevenin\\'. Tell you the truth, I was pretty well tanked up or I\\nwouldn\\'t of done it. I wouldn\\'t do no lady that a-way when I was\\nsober. So I hope, Miss Tildy, you\\'ll accept my \\'pology, and believe\\nthat I wouldn\\'t of done it if I\\'d known what I was doin\\' and hadn\\'t\\nof been drunk.\"\\n\\nWith this handsome plea Mr. Seeders backed away, and departed,\\nfeeling that reparation had been made.\\n\\nBut behind the convenient screen Tildy had thrown herself flat upon\\na table among the butter chips and the coffee cups, and was sobbing\\nher heart out--out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel\\nthey with blunt noses and hay-coloured hair. From her knot she had\\ntorn the red hair-bow and cast it upon the floor. Seeders she\\ndespised utterly; she had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and\\nprophetic prince who might have set the clocks going and the pages to\\nrunning in fairyland. But the kiss had been maudlin and unmeant; the\\ncourt had not stirred at the false alarm; she must forevermore remain\\nthe Sleeping Beauty.\\n\\nYet not all was lost. Aileen\\'s arm was around her; and Tildy\\'s red\\nhand groped among the butter chips till it found the warm clasp of\\nher friend\\'s.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you fret, Til,\" said Aileen, who did not understand entirely.\\n\"That turnip-faced little clothespin of a Seeders ain\\'t worth it. He\\nain\\'t anything of a gentleman or he wouldn\\'t ever of apologised.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FOUR MILLION***\\n\\n\\n******* This file should be named 2776-8.txt or 2776-8.zip *******\\n\\n\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/7/7/2776\\n\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

       "'AFTER TWENTY YEARS The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few. The time was barely 10 o\\'clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh de-peopled the streets. Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed. When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly. \"It\\'s all right, officer,\" he said, reassuringly. \"I\\'m just waiting for a friend. It\\'s an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little funny to you, doesn\\'t it? Well, I\\'ll explain if you\\'d like to make certain it\\'s all straight. About that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands--\\'Big Joe\\' Brady\\'s restaurant.\" \"Until five years ago,\" said the policeman. \"It was torn down then.\" The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly set. \"Twenty years ago to-night,\" said the man, \"I dined here at \\'Big Joe\\' Brady\\'s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers, together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn\\'t have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well, we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made, whatever they were going to be.\" \"It sounds pretty interesting,\" said the policeman. \"Rather a long time between meets, though, it seems to me. Haven\\'t you heard from your friend since you left?\" \"Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,\" said the other. \"But after a year or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he\\'s alive, for he always was the truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He\\'ll never forget. I came a thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it\\'s worth it if my old partner turns up.\" The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with small diamonds. \"Three minutes to ten,\" he announced. \"It was exactly ten o\\'clock when we parted here at the restaurant door.\" \"Did pretty well out West, didn\\'t you?\" asked the policeman. \"You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder, though, good fellow as he was. I\\'ve had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York. It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.\" The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two. \"I\\'ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to call time on him sharp?\" \"I should say not!\" said the other. \"I\\'ll give him half an hour at least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he\\'ll be here by that time. So long, officer.\" \"Good-night, sir,\" said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying doors as he went. There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and waited. About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat, with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man. \"Is that you, Bob?\" he asked, doubtfully. \"Is that you, Jimmy Wells?\" cried the man in the door. \"Bless my heart!\" exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other\\'s hands with his own. \"It\\'s Bob, sure as fate. I was certain I\\'d find you here if you were still in existence. Well, well, well!--twenty years is a long time. The old restaurant\\'s gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so we could have had another dinner there. How has the West treated you, old man?\" \"Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for. You\\'ve changed lots, Jimmy. I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches.\" \"Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty.\" \"Doing well in New York, Jimmy?\" \"Moderately. I have a position in one of the city departments. Come on, Bob; we\\'ll go around to a place I know of, and have a good long talk about old times.\" The two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West, his egotism enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the history of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with interest. At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other\\'s face. The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm. \"You\\'re not Jimmy Wells,\" he snapped. \"Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change a man\\'s nose from a Roman to a pug.\" \"It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one,\" said the tall man. \"You\\'ve been under arrest for ten minutes, \\'Silky\\' Bob. Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you. Going quietly, are you? That\\'s sensible. Now, before we go on to the station here\\'s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it here at the window. It\\'s from Patrolman Wells.\" The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him. His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by the time he had finished. The note was rather short. \"_Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago. Somehow I couldn\\'t do it myself, so I went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job. JIMMY._\"'"

      "AFTER TWENTY YEARS The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk. It's all right, officer,\" he said, reassuringly. \" You couldn't have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. You see, the West is a pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he's alive, for he always was the truest, stanchest old chap in the world. asked the policeman. \" He was a kind of plodder, though, good fellow as he was. I've had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile. I should say not!\" I'll give him half an hour at least. Good-night, sir,\" said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying doors as he went. There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. Is that you, Bob?\" Moderately. The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm. \" You're not Jimmy Wells,\" he snapped. \" Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change a man's nose from a Roman to a pug.\" \" That's sensible. It's from Patrolman Wells.\" When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago.\n"

      "AFTER TWENTY YEARS The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The vicinity was one that kept early hours. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. It's an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little funny to you, doesn't it? His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly set. \" You couldn't have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Haven't you heard from your friend since you left?\" \" You see, the West is a pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he's alive, for he always was the truest, stanchest old chap in the world. asked the policeman. \" He was a kind of plodder, though, good fellow as he was. It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.\" I'll be on my way. So long, officer.\" \" he asked, doubtfully. \" Is that you, Jimmy Wells?\" exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other's hands with his own. \" It's Bob, sure as fate. I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches.\" \" The man from the West, his egotism enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the history of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with interest. The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him. The note was rather short. \"_ Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago. JIMMY._\"\n"

       "'Oscar Fingal O\\'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, the early 1890s saw him become one of the most popular playwrights in London. He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays, his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, and the circumstances of his criminal conviction for \"gross indecency\", imprisonment, and early death at age 46. Wilde\\'s parents were successful Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. A young Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German. At university, Wilde read Greats; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional classicist, first at Trinity College Dublin, then at Oxford. He became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism, led by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles. As a spokesman for aestheticism, he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new \"English Renaissance in Art\" and interior decoration, and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day. At the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into what would be his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote Salome (1891) in French while in Paris but it was refused a licence for England due to an absolute prohibition on the portrayal of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late-Victorian London. At the height of his fame and success, while The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) was still being performed in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde\\'s lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials he was convicted and sentenced to two years\\' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison, he wrote De Profundis (published posthumously in 1905), a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. On his release, he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life.'"

      "Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles. At the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into what would be his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late-Victorian London.\n"

      "Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright. He became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism, led by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles. At the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into what would be his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama.\n"
