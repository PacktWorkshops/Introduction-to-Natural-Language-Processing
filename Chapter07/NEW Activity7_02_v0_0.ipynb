       "483530   This company has called me XXXX times about a \" debt '' that I owe, but will not tell me what this debt is from. I do not know of any outstanding debts that I have, and nor will they tell me what this debt is supposedly from. Were very threatening on the phone that they would continue to come after me. I asked them for verification that they were a true company and not a scam, because I do not give out financial information over the phone, and they would not give me a website or any other way to verify that they were real.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "865088   On XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I have been disputing the inaccuracy of this XXXX XXXX account, and requested proof that this account even belongs to me, such as the original contract with my signature, but the CRA 's have failed to do so and failed to do so within the 30 day period. They are continuing to report XXXX XXXX XXXX, account # XXXX when theres obviously no proof that it even belongs to me. m not saying this is identity theft, but what I am saying is that the CRA 's are required to report all accounts accurately and completely and I know for a fact they didnt verify this account! Wheres the contract with my signature? How can they possibly say that the creditor has verified this account. I have also disputed this information directly with the collections agency and they sent me back a letter stating that a copy of transaction with my name on it verifies that this account belongs to me. Where is the application or contract with my signature? They continuously refuse to provide that information that can assist in accuracy of reporting. Obviously, they do not have verifiable proof that this account belongs to me. I have repeatedly asked to see all documents that were filled out when this account was opened, including an application or contract or this account needs to be removed. Additionally, I asked the CRA 's that they are required by law under section 609 protects me against false reporting and I should point out here that thats exactly what this is!  \n",

       "483530   This company has called me XXXX times about a \" debt '' that I owe, but will not tell me what this debt is from. I do not know of any outstanding debts that I have, and nor will they tell me what this debt is supposedly from. Were very threatening on the phone that they would continue to come after me. I asked them for verification that they were a true company and not a scam, because I do not give out financial information over the phone, and they would not give me a website or any other way to verify that they were real.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "865088   On XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I have been disputing the inaccuracy of this XXXX XXXX account, and requested proof that this account even belongs to me, such as the original contract with my signature, but the CRA 's have failed to do so and failed to do so within the 30 day period. They are continuing to report XXXX XXXX XXXX, account # XXXX when theres obviously no proof that it even belongs to me. m not saying this is identity theft, but what I am saying is that the CRA 's are required to report all accounts accurately and completely and I know for a fact they didnt verify this account! Wheres the contract with my signature? How can they possibly say that the creditor has verified this account. I have also disputed this information directly with the collections agency and they sent me back a letter stating that a copy of transaction with my name on it verifies that this account belongs to me. Where is the application or contract with my signature? They continuously refuse to provide that information that can assist in accuracy of reporting. Obviously, they do not have verifiable proof that this account belongs to me. I have repeatedly asked to see all documents that were filled out when this account was opened, including an application or contract or this account needs to be removed. Additionally, I asked the CRA 's that they are required by law under section 609 protects me against false reporting and I should point out here that thats exactly what this is!   \n",
